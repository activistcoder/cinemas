The wealth of these Native Americans immediately attracted white interlopers, who manipulated, extorted, and stole as much Osage money as they could before resorting to murder. Based on a true story and told through the improbable romance of Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Mollie Kyle (Lily Gladstone), “Killers of the Flower Moon” is an epic western crime saga, where real love crosses paths with unspeakable betrayal. Also starring Robert De Niro and Jesse Plemons, “Killers of the Flower Moon” is directed by Academy Award winner Martin Scorsese from a screenplay by Eric Roth and Martin Scorsese, based on David Grann’s best-selling book.",

Directed by DGA award and five-time Tony award winner George C. Wolfe and starring Emmy award winner Colman Domingo, Rustin shines a long overdue spotlight on the extraordinary man who, alongside giants like the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr., Adam Clayton Powell Jr., and Ella Baker, dared to imagine a different world, and inspired a movement in a march toward freedom. Produced by Academy award winner Bruce Cohen, Higher Ground's Tonia Davis and George C. Wolfe, the film features an all-star cast including Chris Rock, Glynn Turman, Jeffrey Wright and Audra McDonald.",

He had staged a “great escape” from his care home to join fellow war veterans on a beach in Normandy, commemorating their fallen comrades at the D-Day Landings 70th anniversary. It was a story that captured the imagination of the world as Bernie embodied the defiant, “can-do” spirit of a generation that was fast disappearing. But of course, it wasn’t the whole story. It was an inspirational but sanitised retelling of one man’s need to come to terms with the lasting trauma of war. Bernie’s adventure, spanning a mere 48 hours, also marked the culmination of his 60-year marriage to Rene (Glenda Jackson) – THE GREAT ESCAPER celebrates their enduring love but always with an eye to the lessons we might learn from the Greatest Generation.",

      "synopsis": "There has never been a biopic about Samuel Beckett and his remarkable life, and this ground-breaking film pivots around the 1969 Nobel Prize ceremony when he was awarded the prize for Literature. \nHaving been awarded £30,000 along with the Nobel Prize, an embarrassed Beckett simply wanted to be rid of the money, and the film revolves around the internal debate raging within Beckett as to which of the people in his life most deserve to be the financial beneficiaries of his shame. \nBeckett lived a life of many parts: rebellious son of an austere mother, Parisian bon vivant, Resistance fighter, Nobel Prize-winning playwright, unfaithful husband, recluse, but despite all the adulation that came his way he was a man acutely aware of his own failings. We explore these different chapters of his life by having Beckett analyse his past with a representation of his own conscience.\nWith typical Beckettian surrealism we’ll see Sam literally climb the walls at the Nobel Prize ceremony to escape the limelight and flee to a place where, with his trademark deadpan humour, he spars with himself as he explores the most significant relationships of his life: with his mother May, his best friend Alfy, his mentor James Joyce, his wife Suzanne and his mistress Barbara. \nBeckett weaves a compelling narrative of guilt and regret that begins with his oppressive home life in Dublin with his mother May, the reaction to which was a bohemian adventure in Paris working with his friend Alfy as a translator for the legendary Irish author James Joyce.\nJoyce went from intimidating mentor to friend via a period of awkwardness caused by Sam’s spurning of his daughter Lucia’s unrequited affections. His rejection accelerated Lucia’s downward spiral and ultimately landed her in a mental institution. \nAlthough Sam didn’t connect romantically with Lucia, it was in Paris where he met his decades-long partner and eventual wife Suzanne, who he got to know when she visited him in hospital after he had been stabbed by a pimp.\nThis precedes a tense period with the French resistance, whom Beckett helped pass messages under the noses of the Nazis, from whom he and Suzanne had a narrow escape. They fled to Provence and spent the rest of the war living a tough but peaceful existence in the countryside, while Sam’s best friend Alfy wasn’t so lucky. His capture and death in a concentration camp prompts yet more shame. \nNone of this can compare to the guilt occasioned by Beckett’s longstanding affair with a BBC employee, Barbara Bray, that causes irreparable damage to his marriage. Pouring salt in Suzanne’s still open wound, Beckett publicly dramatized their situation in the theatre as ‘Play’, his creative urges yet again causing turbulence in his rollercoaster life. \nSuzanne had acted as the driving force promoting his career, and she remained by his side for the rest of his life despite his numerous infidelities, which were a source of bitterness and rancour. The thing both Sam and Suzanne feared most was success and the spotlight, which they saw as something that could potentially tear them apart, making the award of the Nobel Prize, the ultimate accolade for an author, a veritable ‘catastrophe’, as Beckett described it.",

The expat population teemed with singers, songwriters and musicians, pining for their homeland and producing music from and for the community, amidst the appalling working conditions and racism they encountered in their new home. Love, Deutschmarks and Death follows the music from the early 60s, through waves of migration and assimilation, from back-room recordings to lavish wedding performances, and from bootlegged cassettes to a new generation of young performers.The energy and vibrancy of the music pulses through Cem Kaya's fascinating, archive-rich telling of this rarely shown - or heard - cultural history.\"",

      "synopsis": "At the turn of the 20th century, oil brought a fortune to the Osage Nation, who became some of the richest people in the world overnight. The wealth of these Native Americans immediately attracted white interlopers, who manipulated, extorted, and stole as much Osage money as they could before resorting to murder. Based on a true story and told through the improbable romance of Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Mollie Kyle (Lily Gladstone), “Killers of the Flower Moon” is an epic western crime saga, where real love crosses paths with unspeakable betrayal. Also starring Robert De Niro and Jesse Plemons, “Killers of the Flower Moon” is directed by Academy Award winner Martin Scorsese from a screenplay by Eric Roth and Martin Scorsese, based on David Grann’s best-selling book.",

Directed by DGA award and five-time Tony award winner George C. Wolfe and starring Emmy award winner Colman Domingo, Rustin shines a long overdue spotlight on the extraordinary man who, alongside giants like the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr., Adam Clayton Powell Jr., and Ella Baker, dared to imagine a different world, and inspired a movement in a march toward freedom. Produced by Academy award winner Bruce Cohen, Higher Ground's Tonia Davis and George C. Wolfe, the film features an all-star cast including Chris Rock, Glynn Turman, Jeffrey Wright and Audra McDonald.",

      "synopsis": "There has never been a biopic about Samuel Beckett and his remarkable life, and this ground-breaking film pivots around the 1969 Nobel Prize ceremony when he was awarded the prize for Literature. \nHaving been awarded £30,000 along with the Nobel Prize, an embarrassed Beckett simply wanted to be rid of the money, and the film revolves around the internal debate raging within Beckett as to which of the people in his life most deserve to be the financial beneficiaries of his shame. \nBeckett lived a life of many parts: rebellious son of an austere mother, Parisian bon vivant, Resistance fighter, Nobel Prize-winning playwright, unfaithful husband, recluse, but despite all the adulation that came his way he was a man acutely aware of his own failings. We explore these different chapters of his life by having Beckett analyse his past with a representation of his own conscience.\nWith typical Beckettian surrealism we’ll see Sam literally climb the walls at the Nobel Prize ceremony to escape the limelight and flee to a place where, with his trademark deadpan humour, he spars with himself as he explores the most significant relationships of his life: with his mother May, his best friend Alfy, his mentor James Joyce, his wife Suzanne and his mistress Barbara. \nBeckett weaves a compelling narrative of guilt and regret that begins with his oppressive home life in Dublin with his mother May, the reaction to which was a bohemian adventure in Paris working with his friend Alfy as a translator for the legendary Irish author James Joyce.\nJoyce went from intimidating mentor to friend via a period of awkwardness caused by Sam’s spurning of his daughter Lucia’s unrequited affections. His rejection accelerated Lucia’s downward spiral and ultimately landed her in a mental institution. \nAlthough Sam didn’t connect romantically with Lucia, it was in Paris where he met his decades-long partner and eventual wife Suzanne, who he got to know when she visited him in hospital after he had been stabbed by a pimp.\nThis precedes a tense period with the French resistance, whom Beckett helped pass messages under the noses of the Nazis, from whom he and Suzanne had a narrow escape. They fled to Provence and spent the rest of the war living a tough but peaceful existence in the countryside, while Sam’s best friend Alfy wasn’t so lucky. His capture and death in a concentration camp prompts yet more shame. \nNone of this can compare to the guilt occasioned by Beckett’s longstanding affair with a BBC employee, Barbara Bray, that causes irreparable damage to his marriage. Pouring salt in Suzanne’s still open wound, Beckett publicly dramatized their situation in the theatre as ‘Play’, his creative urges yet again causing turbulence in his rollercoaster life. \nSuzanne had acted as the driving force promoting his career, and she remained by his side for the rest of his life despite his numerous infidelities, which were a source of bitterness and rancour. The thing both Sam and Suzanne feared most was success and the spotlight, which they saw as something that could potentially tear them apart, making the award of the Nobel Prize, the ultimate accolade for an author, a veritable ‘catastrophe’, as Beckett described it.",

Directed by DGA award and five-time Tony award winner George C. Wolfe and starring Emmy award winner Colman Domingo, Rustin shines a long overdue spotlight on the extraordinary man who, alongside giants like the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr., Adam Clayton Powell Jr., and Ella Baker, dared to imagine a different world, and inspired a movement in a march toward freedom. Produced by Academy award winner Bruce Cohen, Higher Ground's Tonia Davis and George C. Wolfe, the film features an all-star cast including Chris Rock, Glynn Turman, Jeffrey Wright and Audra McDonald.",

      "synopsis": "There has never been a biopic about Samuel Beckett and his remarkable life, and this ground-breaking film pivots around the 1969 Nobel Prize ceremony when he was awarded the prize for Literature. \nHaving been awarded £30,000 along with the Nobel Prize, an embarrassed Beckett simply wanted to be rid of the money, and the film revolves around the internal debate raging within Beckett as to which of the people in his life most deserve to be the financial beneficiaries of his shame. \nBeckett lived a life of many parts: rebellious son of an austere mother, Parisian bon vivant, Resistance fighter, Nobel Prize-winning playwright, unfaithful husband, recluse, but despite all the adulation that came his way he was a man acutely aware of his own failings. We explore these different chapters of his life by having Beckett analyse his past with a representation of his own conscience.\nWith typical Beckettian surrealism we’ll see Sam literally climb the walls at the Nobel Prize ceremony to escape the limelight and flee to a place where, with his trademark deadpan humour, he spars with himself as he explores the most significant relationships of his life: with his mother May, his best friend Alfy, his mentor James Joyce, his wife Suzanne and his mistress Barbara. \nBeckett weaves a compelling narrative of guilt and regret that begins with his oppressive home life in Dublin with his mother May, the reaction to which was a bohemian adventure in Paris working with his friend Alfy as a translator for the legendary Irish author James Joyce.\nJoyce went from intimidating mentor to friend via a period of awkwardness caused by Sam’s spurning of his daughter Lucia’s unrequited affections. His rejection accelerated Lucia’s downward spiral and ultimately landed her in a mental institution. \nAlthough Sam didn’t connect romantically with Lucia, it was in Paris where he met his decades-long partner and eventual wife Suzanne, who he got to know when she visited him in hospital after he had been stabbed by a pimp.\nThis precedes a tense period with the French resistance, whom Beckett helped pass messages under the noses of the Nazis, from whom he and Suzanne had a narrow escape. They fled to Provence and spent the rest of the war living a tough but peaceful existence in the countryside, while Sam’s best friend Alfy wasn’t so lucky. His capture and death in a concentration camp prompts yet more shame. \nNone of this can compare to the guilt occasioned by Beckett’s longstanding affair with a BBC employee, Barbara Bray, that causes irreparable damage to his marriage. Pouring salt in Suzanne’s still open wound, Beckett publicly dramatized their situation in the theatre as ‘Play’, his creative urges yet again causing turbulence in his rollercoaster life. \nSuzanne had acted as the driving force promoting his career, and she remained by his side for the rest of his life despite his numerous infidelities, which were a source of bitterness and rancour. The thing both Sam and Suzanne feared most was success and the spotlight, which they saw as something that could potentially tear them apart, making the award of the Nobel Prize, the ultimate accolade for an author, a veritable ‘catastrophe’, as Beckett described it.",

The wealth of these Native Americans immediately attracted white interlopers, who manipulated, extorted, and stole as much Osage money as they could before resorting to murder. Based on a true story and told through the improbable romance of Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Mollie Kyle (Lily Gladstone), “Killers of the Flower Moon” is an epic western crime saga, where real love crosses paths with unspeakable betrayal. Also starring Robert De Niro and Jesse Plemons, “Killers of the Flower Moon” is directed by Academy Award winner Martin Scorsese from a screenplay by Eric Roth and Martin Scorsese, based on David Grann’s best-selling book.",

Is There Anybody Out There? is a personal documentary following my search to track down other individuals with the same rare disability as me. The film also explores the experience of being a disabled pregnant woman as well as the emotional process of becoming a mother, when I unexpectedly find out I am pregnant. Perhaps, more than anything however, this story is about ableism – about living in a world where you’re seen as less than human – and what it takes to love yourself fiercely despite this.” \r\n\r\nReclaim The Frame is an organisation dedicated to bringing ever greater audiences to films by people from marginalised genders to offer a wider perspective of the world.

Directed by DGA award and five-time Tony award winner George C. Wolfe and starring Emmy award winner Colman Domingo, Rustin shines a long overdue spotlight on the extraordinary man who, alongside giants like the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr., Adam Clayton Powell Jr., and Ella Baker, dared to imagine a different world, and inspired a movement in a march toward freedom. Produced by Academy award winner Bruce Cohen, Higher Ground's Tonia Davis and George C. Wolfe, the film features an all-star cast including Chris Rock, Glynn Turman, Jeffrey Wright and Audra McDonald.",

      "synopsis": "There has never been a biopic about Samuel Beckett and his remarkable life, and this ground-breaking film pivots around the 1969 Nobel Prize ceremony when he was awarded the prize for Literature. \nHaving been awarded £30,000 along with the Nobel Prize, an embarrassed Beckett simply wanted to be rid of the money, and the film revolves around the internal debate raging within Beckett as to which of the people in his life most deserve to be the financial beneficiaries of his shame. \nBeckett lived a life of many parts: rebellious son of an austere mother, Parisian bon vivant, Resistance fighter, Nobel Prize-winning playwright, unfaithful husband, recluse, but despite all the adulation that came his way he was a man acutely aware of his own failings. We explore these different chapters of his life by having Beckett analyse his past with a representation of his own conscience.\nWith typical Beckettian surrealism we’ll see Sam literally climb the walls at the Nobel Prize ceremony to escape the limelight and flee to a place where, with his trademark deadpan humour, he spars with himself as he explores the most significant relationships of his life: with his mother May, his best friend Alfy, his mentor James Joyce, his wife Suzanne and his mistress Barbara. \nBeckett weaves a compelling narrative of guilt and regret that begins with his oppressive home life in Dublin with his mother May, the reaction to which was a bohemian adventure in Paris working with his friend Alfy as a translator for the legendary Irish author James Joyce.\nJoyce went from intimidating mentor to friend via a period of awkwardness caused by Sam’s spurning of his daughter Lucia’s unrequited affections. His rejection accelerated Lucia’s downward spiral and ultimately landed her in a mental institution. \nAlthough Sam didn’t connect romantically with Lucia, it was in Paris where he met his decades-long partner and eventual wife Suzanne, who he got to know when she visited him in hospital after he had been stabbed by a pimp.\nThis precedes a tense period with the French resistance, whom Beckett helped pass messages under the noses of the Nazis, from whom he and Suzanne had a narrow escape. They fled to Provence and spent the rest of the war living a tough but peaceful existence in the countryside, while Sam’s best friend Alfy wasn’t so lucky. His capture and death in a concentration camp prompts yet more shame. \nNone of this can compare to the guilt occasioned by Beckett’s longstanding affair with a BBC employee, Barbara Bray, that causes irreparable damage to his marriage. Pouring salt in Suzanne’s still open wound, Beckett publicly dramatized their situation in the theatre as ‘Play’, his creative urges yet again causing turbulence in his rollercoaster life. \nSuzanne had acted as the driving force promoting his career, and she remained by his side for the rest of his life despite his numerous infidelities, which were a source of bitterness and rancour. The thing both Sam and Suzanne feared most was success and the spotlight, which they saw as something that could potentially tear them apart, making the award of the Nobel Prize, the ultimate accolade for an author, a veritable ‘catastrophe’, as Beckett described it.",

His intention was to come across as an uncharismatic clerk who merely followed orders, and to downplay his role in managing the mass deportation of Jews. But only four year earlier, feeling increasingly secure in his adoptive country of Argentina, Eichmann spoke freely and boastfully – in a series of taped conversations with Dutch Nazi journalist Willem Sassen – of the idealistic fervour that made him excel at his job, and his deep regret about not sending many more millions of Jews to their deaths. The transcripts of the recordings played a crucial part in Eichmann’s trial but the whereabouts of the tapes remained unknown for years. This fascinating documentary unearth the recordings and sheds light on the realpolitik considerations that may have contributed to their disappearance.",

As blunt as she is brave, Angel keeps putting her livelihood on the line to fight for a free press, and the rights of journalists like herself to hold power to account.\r\n\r\nAn edge-of-your-seat tale that unfurls with energy, humour and suspense, Bad Press is a timely story about the battle against media censorship.",

The Eternal Memory is both an inquiry into human dignity in old age and adversity, and into the mechanisms of individual and collective remembrance. What – and who – do we recall from our past? Why do we forget or suppress certain memories, and what effect does this have, on a person as well as on an entire country?",

The wealth of these Native Americans immediately attracted white interlopers, who manipulated, extorted, and stole as much Osage money as they could before resorting to murder. Based on a true story and told through the improbable romance of Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Mollie Kyle (Lily Gladstone), “Killers of the Flower Moon” is an epic western crime saga, where real love crosses paths with unspeakable betrayal. Also starring Robert De Niro and Jesse Plemons, “Killers of the Flower Moon” is directed by Academy Award winner Martin Scorsese from a screenplay by Eric Roth and Martin Scorsese, based on David Grann’s best-selling book.",

Directed by DGA award and five-time Tony award winner George C.

Produced by Academy award winner Bruce Cohen, Higher Ground's Tonia Davis and George C.

      "synopsis": "There has never been a biopic about Samuel Beckett and his remarkable life, and this ground-breaking film pivots around the 1969 Nobel Prize ceremony when he was awarded the prize for Literature. \nHaving been awarded £30,000 along with the Nobel Prize, an embarrassed Beckett simply wanted to be rid of the money, and the film revolves around the internal debate raging within Beckett as to which of the people in his life most deserve to be the financial beneficiaries of his shame. \nBeckett lived a life of many parts: rebellious son of an austere mother, Parisian bon vivant, Resistance fighter, Nobel Prize-winning playwright, unfaithful husband, recluse, but despite all the adulation that came his way he was a man acutely aware of his own failings. We explore these different chapters of his life by having Beckett analyse his past with a representation of his own conscience.\nWith typical Beckettian surrealism we’ll see Sam literally climb the walls at the Nobel Prize ceremony to escape the limelight and flee to a place where, with his trademark deadpan humour, he spars with himself as he explores the most significant relationships of his life: with his mother May, his best friend Alfy, his mentor James Joyce, his wife Suzanne and his mistress Barbara. \nBeckett weaves a compelling narrative of guilt and regret that begins with his oppressive home life in Dublin with his mother May, the reaction to which was a bohemian adventure in Paris working with his friend Alfy as a translator for the legendary Irish author James Joyce.\nJoyce went from intimidating mentor to friend via a period of awkwardness caused by Sam’s spurning of his daughter Lucia’s unrequited affections. His rejection accelerated Lucia’s downward spiral and ultimately landed her in a mental institution. \nAlthough Sam didn’t connect romantically with Lucia, it was in Paris where he met his decades-long partner and eventual wife Suzanne, who he got to know when she visited him in hospital after he had been stabbed by a pimp.\nThis precedes a tense period with the French resistance, whom Beckett helped pass messages under the noses of the Nazis, from whom he and Suzanne had a narrow escape. They fled to Provence and spent the rest of the war living a tough but peaceful existence in the countryside, while Sam’s best friend Alfy wasn’t so lucky. His capture and death in a concentration camp prompts yet more shame. \nNone of this can compare to the guilt occasioned by Beckett’s longstanding affair with a BBC employee, Barbara Bray, that causes irreparable damage to his marriage. Pouring salt in Suzanne’s still open wound, Beckett publicly dramatized their situation in the theatre as ‘Play’, his creative urges yet again causing turbulence in his rollercoaster life. \nSuzanne had acted as the driving force promoting his career, and she remained by his side for the rest of his life despite his numerous infidelities, which were a source of bitterness and rancour. The thing both Sam and Suzanne feared most was success and the spotlight, which they saw as something that could potentially tear them apart, making the award of the Nobel Prize, the ultimate accolade for an author, a veritable ‘catastrophe’, as Beckett described it.",

The Eternal Memory is both an inquiry into human dignity in old age and adversity, and into the mechanisms of individual and collective remembrance. What – and who – do we recall from our past? Why do we forget or suppress certain memories, and what effect does this have, on a person as well as on an entire country?",

The wealth of these Native Americans immediately attracted white interlopers, who manipulated, extorted, and stole as much Osage money as they could before resorting to murder. Based on a true story and told through the improbable romance of Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Mollie Kyle (Lily Gladstone), “Killers of the Flower Moon” is an epic western crime saga, where real love crosses paths with unspeakable betrayal. Also starring Robert De Niro and Jesse Plemons, “Killers of the Flower Moon” is directed by Academy Award winner Martin Scorsese from a screenplay by Eric Roth and Martin Scorsese, based on David Grann’s best-selling book.",

Directed by DGA award and five-time Tony award winner George C. Wolfe and starring Emmy award winner Colman Domingo, Rustin shines a long overdue spotlight on the extraordinary man who, alongside giants like the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr., Adam Clayton Powell Jr., and Ella Baker, dared to imagine a different world, and inspired a movement in a march toward freedom. Produced by Academy award winner Bruce Cohen, Higher Ground's Tonia Davis and George C. Wolfe, the film features an all-star cast including Chris Rock, Glynn Turman, Jeffrey Wright and Audra McDonald.",

      "synopsis": "There has never been a biopic about Samuel Beckett and his remarkable life, and this ground-breaking film pivots around the 1969 Nobel Prize ceremony when he was awarded the prize for Literature. \nHaving been awarded £30,000 along with the Nobel Prize, an embarrassed Beckett simply wanted to be rid of the money, and the film revolves around the internal debate raging within Beckett as to which of the people in his life most deserve to be the financial beneficiaries of his shame. \nBeckett lived a life of many parts: rebellious son of an austere mother, Parisian bon vivant, Resistance fighter, Nobel Prize-winning playwright, unfaithful husband, recluse, but despite all the adulation that came his way he was a man acutely aware of his own failings. We explore these different chapters of his life by having Beckett analyse his past with a representation of his own conscience.\nWith typical Beckettian surrealism we’ll see Sam literally climb the walls at the Nobel Prize ceremony to escape the limelight and flee to a place where, with his trademark deadpan humour, he spars with himself as he explores the most significant relationships of his life: with his mother May, his best friend Alfy, his mentor James Joyce, his wife Suzanne and his mistress Barbara. \nBeckett weaves a compelling narrative of guilt and regret that begins with his oppressive home life in Dublin with his mother May, the reaction to which was a bohemian adventure in Paris working with his friend Alfy as a translator for the legendary Irish author James Joyce.\nJoyce went from intimidating mentor to friend via a period of awkwardness caused by Sam’s spurning of his daughter Lucia’s unrequited affections. His rejection accelerated Lucia’s downward spiral and ultimately landed her in a mental institution. \nAlthough Sam didn’t connect romantically with Lucia, it was in Paris where he met his decades-long partner and eventual wife Suzanne, who he got to know when she visited him in hospital after he had been stabbed by a pimp.\nThis precedes a tense period with the French resistance, whom Beckett helped pass messages under the noses of the Nazis, from whom he and Suzanne had a narrow escape. They fled to Provence and spent the rest of the war living a tough but peaceful existence in the countryside, while Sam’s best friend Alfy wasn’t so lucky. His capture and death in a concentration camp prompts yet more shame. \nNone of this can compare to the guilt occasioned by Beckett’s longstanding affair with a BBC employee, Barbara Bray, that causes irreparable damage to his marriage. Pouring salt in Suzanne’s still open wound, Beckett publicly dramatized their situation in the theatre as ‘Play’, his creative urges yet again causing turbulence in his rollercoaster life. \nSuzanne had acted as the driving force promoting his career, and she remained by his side for the rest of his life despite his numerous infidelities, which were a source of bitterness and rancour. The thing both Sam and Suzanne feared most was success and the spotlight, which they saw as something that could potentially tear them apart, making the award of the Nobel Prize, the ultimate accolade for an author, a veritable ‘catastrophe’, as Beckett described it.",

As blunt as she is brave, Angel keeps putting her livelihood on the line to fight for a free press, and the rights of journalists like herself to hold power to account.\r\n\r\nAn edge-of-your-seat tale that unfurls with energy, humour and suspense, Bad Press is a timely story about the battle against media censorship.",

The Eternal Memory is both an inquiry into human dignity in old age and adversity, and into the mechanisms of individual and collective remembrance. What – and who – do we recall from our past? Why do we forget or suppress certain memories, and what effect does this have, on a person as well as on an entire country?",

Stolen places these Church and state-run institutions in the context of Irish history and culture, and asks how and why it took decades for the breadth of this scandal to be revealed, investigated and condemned. At the emotionally-potent centre of this somber and vital film are the survivors who are invited to tell their stories; the stories of children who grew up never knowing their families, of young people who moved from one institution to another all their lives and of mothers forced to give away their babies.",

      "synopsis": "At the turn of the 20th century, oil brought a fortune to the Osage Nation, who became some of the richest people in the world overnight. The wealth of these Native Americans immediately attracted white interlopers, who manipulated, extorted, and stole as much Osage money as they could before resorting to murder. Based on a true story and told through the improbable romance of Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Mollie Kyle (Lily Gladstone), “Killers of the Flower Moon” is an epic western crime saga, where real love crosses paths with unspeakable betrayal. Also starring Robert De Niro and Jesse Plemons, “Killers of the Flower Moon” is directed by Academy Award winner Martin Scorsese from a screenplay by Eric Roth and Martin Scorsese, based on David Grann’s best-selling book.",

Directed by DGA award and five-time Tony award winner George C. Wolfe and starring Emmy award winner Colman Domingo, Rustin shines a long overdue spotlight on the extraordinary man who, alongside giants like the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr., Adam Clayton Powell Jr., and Ella Baker, dared to imagine a different world, and inspired a movement in a march toward freedom. Produced by Academy award winner Bruce Cohen, Higher Ground's Tonia Davis and George C. Wolfe, the film features an all-star cast including Chris Rock, Glynn Turman, Jeffrey Wright and Audra McDonald.",

      "synopsis": "There has never been a biopic about Samuel Beckett and his remarkable life, and this ground-breaking film pivots around the 1969 Nobel Prize ceremony when he was awarded the prize for Literature. \nHaving been awarded £30,000 along with the Nobel Prize, an embarrassed Beckett simply wanted to be rid of the money, and the film revolves around the internal debate raging within Beckett as to which of the people in his life most deserve to be the financial beneficiaries of his shame. \nBeckett lived a life of many parts: rebellious son of an austere mother, Parisian bon vivant, Resistance fighter, Nobel Prize-winning playwright, unfaithful husband, recluse, but despite all the adulation that came his way he was a man acutely aware of his own failings. We explore these different chapters of his life by having Beckett analyse his past with a representation of his own conscience.\nWith typical Beckettian surrealism we’ll see Sam literally climb the walls at the Nobel Prize ceremony to escape the limelight and flee to a place where, with his trademark deadpan humour, he spars with himself as he explores the most significant relationships of his life: with his mother May, his best friend Alfy, his mentor James Joyce, his wife Suzanne and his mistress Barbara. \nBeckett weaves a compelling narrative of guilt and regret that begins with his oppressive home life in Dublin with his mother May, the reaction to which was a bohemian adventure in Paris working with his friend Alfy as a translator for the legendary Irish author James Joyce.\nJoyce went from intimidating mentor to friend via a period of awkwardness caused by Sam’s spurning of his daughter Lucia’s unrequited affections. His rejection accelerated Lucia’s downward spiral and ultimately landed her in a mental institution. \nAlthough Sam didn’t connect romantically with Lucia, it was in Paris where he met his decades-long partner and eventual wife Suzanne, who he got to know when she visited him in hospital after he had been stabbed by a pimp.\nThis precedes a tense period with the French resistance, whom Beckett helped pass messages under the noses of the Nazis, from whom he and Suzanne had a narrow escape. They fled to Provence and spent the rest of the war living a tough but peaceful existence in the countryside, while Sam’s best friend Alfy wasn’t so lucky. His capture and death in a concentration camp prompts yet more shame. \nNone of this can compare to the guilt occasioned by Beckett’s longstanding affair with a BBC employee, Barbara Bray, that causes irreparable damage to his marriage. Pouring salt in Suzanne’s still open wound, Beckett publicly dramatized their situation in the theatre as ‘Play’, his creative urges yet again causing turbulence in his rollercoaster life. \nSuzanne had acted as the driving force promoting his career, and she remained by his side for the rest of his life despite his numerous infidelities, which were a source of bitterness and rancour. The thing both Sam and Suzanne feared most was success and the spotlight, which they saw as something that could potentially tear them apart, making the award of the Nobel Prize, the ultimate accolade for an author, a veritable ‘catastrophe’, as Beckett described it.",

The Eternal Memory is both an inquiry into human dignity in old age and adversity, and into the mechanisms of individual and collective remembrance. What – and who – do we recall from our past?

Directed by DGA award and five-time Tony award winner George C. Wolfe and starring Emmy award winner Colman Domingo, Rustin shines a long overdue spotlight on the extraordinary man who, alongside giants like the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr., Adam Clayton Powell Jr., and Ella Baker, dared to imagine a different world, and inspired a movement in a march toward freedom. Produced by Academy award winner Bruce Cohen, Higher Ground's Tonia Davis and George C. Wolfe, the film features an all-star cast including Chris Rock, Glynn Turman, Jeffrey Wright and Audra McDonald.",

      "synopsis": "There has never been a biopic about Samuel Beckett and his remarkable life, and this ground-breaking film pivots around the 1969 Nobel Prize ceremony when he was awarded the prize for Literature. \nHaving been awarded £30,000 along with the Nobel Prize, an embarrassed Beckett simply wanted to be rid of the money, and the film revolves around the internal debate raging within Beckett as to which of the people in his life most deserve to be the financial beneficiaries of his shame. \nBeckett lived a life of many parts: rebellious son of an austere mother, Parisian bon vivant, Resistance fighter, Nobel Prize-winning playwright, unfaithful husband, recluse, but despite all the adulation that came his way he was a man acutely aware of his own failings. We explore these different chapters of his life by having Beckett analyse his past with a representation of his own conscience.\nWith typical Beckettian surrealism we’ll see Sam literally climb the walls at the Nobel Prize ceremony to escape the limelight and flee to a place where, with his trademark deadpan humour, he spars with himself as he explores the most significant relationships of his life: with his mother May, his best friend Alfy, his mentor James Joyce, his wife Suzanne and his mistress Barbara. \nBeckett weaves a compelling narrative of guilt and regret that begins with his oppressive home life in Dublin with his mother May, the reaction to which was a bohemian adventure in Paris working with his friend Alfy as a translator for the legendary Irish author James Joyce.\nJoyce went from intimidating mentor to friend via a period of awkwardness caused by Sam’s spurning of his daughter Lucia’s unrequited affections. His rejection accelerated Lucia’s downward spiral and ultimately landed her in a mental institution. \nAlthough Sam didn’t connect romantically with Lucia, it was in Paris where he met his decades-long partner and eventual wife Suzanne, who he got to know when she visited him in hospital after he had been stabbed by a pimp.\nThis precedes a tense period with the French resistance, whom Beckett helped pass messages under the noses of the Nazis, from whom he and Suzanne had a narrow escape. They fled to Provence and spent the rest of the war living a tough but peaceful existence in the countryside, while Sam’s best friend Alfy wasn’t so lucky. His capture and death in a concentration camp prompts yet more shame. \nNone of this can compare to the guilt occasioned by Beckett’s longstanding affair with a BBC employee, Barbara Bray, that causes irreparable damage to his marriage. Pouring salt in Suzanne’s still open wound, Beckett publicly dramatized their situation in the theatre as ‘Play’, his creative urges yet again causing turbulence in his rollercoaster life. \nSuzanne had acted as the driving force promoting his career, and she remained by his side for the rest of his life despite his numerous infidelities, which were a source of bitterness and rancour. The thing both Sam and Suzanne feared most was success and the spotlight, which they saw as something that could potentially tear them apart, making the award of the Nobel Prize, the ultimate accolade for an author, a veritable ‘catastrophe’, as Beckett described it.",

But he did so with strangers, not his own family – his wife and four children. This stunning new animated film, released shortly after Henri’s death in 2020, aged 94, is based on a graphic novel by his son Michel, one of Israel’s most beloved cartoonists. Featuring the voices of screen legends Elliott Gould and Miriam Margolyes, as well as Tracy-Ann Oberman and David Baddiel, My Father’s Secrets is a heartrending yet deeply uplifting tale of remembrance, love and forgiveness. A wonderful tribute to a man who taught his son the art of drawing, described by Michel as their own wordless language.\r\n",
