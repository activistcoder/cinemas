For over two years, Wenders traced Kiefer’s path from his native Germany to his current home in France, connecting the stages of his life to the essential places of his career that spans more than five decades.\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: Due to an unexpected 3D glasses supply issue at Mayfair, all our Anselm 3D shows will likely be in 2D. We apologise for any inconvenience, as we work to solve the issue and get back to 3D shows as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nMayfair’s new 3D system requires special electronic 3D glasses that we intend to hand out to customers at each 3D performance. At all other venues, commonly used passive 3D glasses will be available to purchase for £1.50, or you can bring your own pair.\r\n\r\n2D performances are available at Soho, Bloomsbury, Hoxton, Richmond, Camden, Wimbledon and Knutsford.",

From lost phone numbers to mistaken addresses, alcoholism and a charming stray dog, the pair’s path to happiness is as bittersweet as it is ultimately delightful. \n\nShot through with Kaurismäki’s typically playful, idiosyncratic style and deadpan sense of humor, this tender romantic tragicomedy is both a loving tribute to the filmmaker’s beloved contemporaries and a timely reminder of the potency of movie-going from one of cinema’s living legends.

When Jagna finds herself caught between the conflicting desires of the village’s richest farmer, his eldest son, and other leading men of the community, her resistance puts her on a tragic collision course with the community around her.",

Wim Wenders creates a portrait of Anselm Kiefer, one of the most innovative and important painters and sculptors of our time, shot in 3D and 6K-resolution. \n\nThe film presents a total immersion in the artist’s work and practice which explores human existence and the cyclical nature of history, inspired by literature, poetry, philosophy, science, mythology and religion. For over two years, Wenders traced Kiefer’s path from his native Germany to his current home in France, connecting the stages of his life to the essential places of his career that spans more than five decades.\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: Due to an unexpected 3D glasses supply issue at Mayfair, all our Anselm 3D shows will likely be in 2D. We apologise for any inconvenience, as we work to solve the issue and get back to 3D shows as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nMayfair’s new 3D system requires special electronic 3D glasses that we intend to hand out to customers at each 3D performance. At all other venues, commonly used passive 3D glasses will be available to purchase for £1.50, or you can bring your own pair.\r\n\r\n2D performances are available at Soho, Bloomsbury, Hoxton, Richmond, Camden, Wimbledon and Knutsford.",

THE HUNGER GAMES: THE BALLAD OF SONGBIRDS & SNAKES follows a young Coriolanus (Tom Blyth) who is the last hope for his failing lineage, the once-proud Snow family that has fallen from grace in a post-war Capitol. With his livelihood threatened, Snow is reluctantly assigned to mentor Lucy Gray Baird (Rachel Zegler), a tribute from the impoverished District 12. But after Lucy Gray’s charm captivates the audience of Panem, Snow sees an opportunity to shift their fates. With everything he has worked for hanging in the balance, Snow unites with Lucy Gray to turn the odds in their favor. Battling his instincts for both good and evil, Snow sets out on a race against time to survive and reveal if he will ultimately become a songbird or a snake.",

From lost phone numbers to mistaken addresses, alcoholism and a charming stray dog, the pair’s path to happiness is as bittersweet as it is ultimately delightful. \n\nShot through with Kaurismäki’s typically playful, idiosyncratic style and deadpan sense of humor, this tender romantic tragicomedy is both a loving tribute to the filmmaker’s beloved contemporaries and a timely reminder of the potency of movie-going from one of cinema’s living legends.

When Jagna finds herself caught between the conflicting desires of the village’s richest farmer, his eldest son, and other leading men of the community, her resistance puts her on a tragic collision course with the community around her.",

She stages radical performances that become a new form of art and activism, but her defiance comes at a price.\r\n\r\nRaised in a small town by her grandparents, Gena leaves to study in Moscow. Through evocative performances, she protests against the government and sheds light on the persecution endured by the LGBTQ+ community. This defiant young activist faces a multitude of challenges, notably the looming threat of compulsory military conscription. Her raw vulnerability is exposed, as she searches for acceptance in a place that adamantly rejects her identity.\r\n\r\nFilmed over four years, and spanning the outbreak of war, Queendom is much more than just an artist's portrait. This visually striking yet thought-provoking film encapsulates a crucial turning point in Russia's transition from its older to younger generation.",

For over two years, Wenders traced Kiefer’s path from his native Germany to his current home in France, connecting the stages of his life to the essential places of his career that spans more than five decades.\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: Due to an unexpected 3D glasses supply issue at Mayfair, all our Anselm 3D shows will likely be in 2D. We apologise for any inconvenience, as we work to solve the issue and get back to 3D shows as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nMayfair’s new 3D system requires special electronic 3D glasses that we intend to hand out to customers at each 3D performance. At all other venues, commonly used passive 3D glasses will be available to purchase for £1.50, or you can bring your own pair.\r\n\r\n2D performances are available at Soho, Bloomsbury, Hoxton, Richmond, Camden, Wimbledon and Knutsford.",

THE HUNGER GAMES: THE BALLAD OF SONGBIRDS & SNAKES follows a young Coriolanus (Tom Blyth) who is the last hope for his failing lineage, the once-proud Snow family that has fallen from grace in a post-war Capitol. With his livelihood threatened, Snow is reluctantly assigned to mentor Lucy Gray Baird (Rachel Zegler), a tribute from the impoverished District 12. But after Lucy Gray’s charm captivates the audience of Panem, Snow sees an opportunity to shift their fates. With everything he has worked for hanging in the balance, Snow unites with Lucy Gray to turn the odds in their favor. Battling his instincts for both good and evil, Snow sets out on a race against time to survive and reveal if he will ultimately become a songbird or a snake.",

From lost phone numbers to mistaken addresses, alcoholism and a charming stray dog, the pair’s path to happiness is as bittersweet as it is ultimately delightful. \n\nShot through with Kaurismäki’s typically playful, idiosyncratic style and deadpan sense of humor, this tender romantic tragicomedy is both a loving tribute to the filmmaker’s beloved contemporaries and a timely reminder of the potency of movie-going from one of cinema’s living legends.

Though he embraces this exciting new exploration, the novelty of being with a woman starts to fade when Martin begins an affair of his own, forcing Tomas to confront life decisions he may be unprepared – or unwilling – to deal with. \n\nPerceptive, intimate and unashamedly sexy, PASSAGES sees Sachs put a uniquely European spin on his usually tender style, telling a messy, modern love story that explores the complexities, contradictions and cruelties of sex and desire.",

Also starring Robert De Niro and Jesse Plemons, “Killers of the Flower Moon” is directed by Academy Award winner Martin Scorsese from a screenplay by Eric Roth and Martin Scorsese, based on David Grann’s best-selling book.",

For over two years, Wenders traced Kiefer’s path from his native Germany to his current home in France, connecting the stages of his life to the essential places of his career that spans more than five decades.\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: Due to an unexpected 3D glasses supply issue at Mayfair, all our Anselm 3D shows will likely be in 2D. We apologise for any inconvenience, as we work to solve the issue and get back to 3D shows as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nMayfair’s new 3D system requires special electronic 3D glasses that we intend to hand out to customers at each 3D performance. At all other venues, commonly used passive 3D glasses will be available to purchase for £1.50, or you can bring your own pair.\r\n\r\n2D performances are available at Soho, Bloomsbury, Hoxton, Richmond, Camden, Wimbledon and Knutsford.",

From lost phone numbers to mistaken addresses, alcoholism and a charming stray dog, the pair’s path to happiness is as bittersweet as it is ultimately delightful. \n\nShot through with Kaurismäki’s typically playful, idiosyncratic style and deadpan sense of humor, this tender romantic tragicomedy is both a loving tribute to the filmmaker’s beloved contemporaries and a timely reminder of the potency of movie-going from one of cinema’s living legends.

Born in the northern coastal town of South Shields, she was driven by a fierce conviction to record the impact of Thatcher era de-industrialisation upon local communities. Her striking black and white photos convey a tenderness and intimacy that set her apart from her peers and her work would become a powerful record of a world decimated by a new and ruthless form of capitalism. .\r\n \r\nThe film follows Tish’s daughter Ella as she revisits key moments from her mother’s life and work. She is accompanied by people who remained close to Tish throughout her life, and who are committed to ensuring her remarkable legacy is recognised.\r\n",

Winning multiple awards at film festivals across the world including Toronto and Palm Springs, it show's how one family's strength can force a social reckoning that will reverberate for years to come.\r\n\r\nTo Kill a Tiger deals with highly sensitive subject matter and contains depictions of sexual violence, which may be triggering for some viewers.",

Cohen approaches this sensitive subject gently and yet with a real joy and enthusiasm for River, Alicia and Saifa, who are trailblazing a path of acceptance for the many people across the world born with sex characteristics that don't fit the binary notions of 'male' and 'female'.

For over two years, Wenders traced Kiefer’s path from his native Germany to his current home in France, connecting the stages of his life to the essential places of his career that spans more than five decades.\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: Due to an unexpected 3D glasses supply issue at Mayfair, all our Anselm 3D shows will likely be in 2D. We apologise for any inconvenience, as we work to solve the issue and get back to 3D shows as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nMayfair’s new 3D system requires special electronic 3D glasses that we intend to hand out to customers at each 3D performance. At all other venues, commonly used passive 3D glasses will be available to purchase for £1.50, or you can bring your own pair.\r\n\r\n2D performances are available at Soho, Bloomsbury, Hoxton, Richmond, Camden, Wimbledon and Knutsford.",

From lost phone numbers to mistaken addresses, alcoholism and a charming stray dog, the pair’s path to happiness is as bittersweet as it is ultimately delightful. \n\nShot through with Kaurismäki’s typically playful, idiosyncratic style and deadpan sense of humor, this tender romantic tragicomedy is both a loving tribute to the filmmaker’s beloved contemporaries and a timely reminder of the potency of movie-going from one of cinema’s living legends.

(1976), a film commissioned to recruit UK prison guards. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe programme considers the ethical contradictions that shape Krish's films, and his treatment of the documentary form, leveraging, as critic Patrick Russell puts it: 'whatever manipulation of superficially perceptible reality required’ to draw his viewers’ attention to an underlying, overlooked truth about the world – 'those particular truths that the film-maker and his sponsor have agreed to communicate'.",

A young woman in her 20s, Therese Belivet (Rooney Mara), is a clerk working in a Manhattan department store and dreaming of a more fulfilling life when she meets Carol (Cate Blanchett), an alluring woman trapped in a loveless, convenient marriage. As an immediate connection sparks between them, the innocence of their first encounter dims and their connection deepens.

Born in the northern coastal town of South Shields, she was driven by a fierce conviction to record the impact of Thatcher era de-industrialisation upon local communities. Her striking black and white photos convey a tenderness and intimacy that set her apart from her peers and her work would become a powerful record of a world decimated by a new and ruthless form of capitalism. .\r\n \r\nThe film follows Tish’s daughter Ella as she revisits key moments from her mother’s life and work.

THE HUNGER GAMES: THE BALLAD OF SONGBIRDS & SNAKES follows a young Coriolanus (Tom Blyth) who is the last hope for his failing lineage, the once-proud Snow family that has fallen from grace in a post-war Capitol. With his livelihood threatened, Snow is reluctantly assigned to mentor Lucy Gray Baird (Rachel Zegler), a tribute from the impoverished District 12. But after Lucy Gray’s charm captivates the audience of Panem, Snow sees an opportunity to shift their fates. With everything he has worked for hanging in the balance, Snow unites with Lucy Gray to turn the odds in their favor. Battling his instincts for both good and evil, Snow sets out on a race against time to survive and reveal if he will ultimately become a songbird or a snake.",

Wim Wenders creates a portrait of Anselm Kiefer, one of the most innovative and important painters and sculptors of our time, shot in 3D and 6K-resolution. \n\nThe film presents a total immersion in the artist’s work and practice which explores human existence and the cyclical nature of history, inspired by literature, poetry, philosophy, science, mythology and religion. For over two years, Wenders traced Kiefer’s path from his native Germany to his current home in France, connecting the stages of his life to the essential places of his career that spans more than five decades.\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: Due to an unexpected 3D glasses supply issue at Mayfair, all our Anselm 3D shows will likely be in 2D. We apologise for any inconvenience, as we work to solve the issue and get back to 3D shows as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nMayfair’s new 3D system requires special electronic 3D glasses that we intend to hand out to customers at each 3D performance. At all other venues, commonly used passive 3D glasses will be available to purchase for £1.50, or you can bring your own pair.\r\n\r\n2D performances are available at Soho, Bloomsbury, Hoxton, Richmond, Camden, Wimbledon and Knutsford.",

      "synopsis": "Award-winning filmmaker Aki Kaurismäki (Le Havre, The Other Side of Hope) makes a masterful return with FALLEN LEAVES, a timeless, hopeful and satisfying love story that won the Jury Prize at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival.\n\nSet in modern day Helsinki, the film tells the story of Ansa (Alma Pöysti) and Holappa (Jussi Vatanen), two lonely souls whose chance meeting at a local karaoke bar is beset by numerous hurdles. From lost phone numbers to mistaken addresses, alcoholism and a charming stray dog, the pair’s path to happiness is as bittersweet as it is ultimately delightful. \n\nShot through with Kaurismäki’s typically playful, idiosyncratic style and deadpan sense of humor, this tender romantic tragicomedy is both a loving tribute to the filmmaker’s beloved contemporaries and a timely reminder of the potency of movie-going from one of cinema’s living legends.

When his mother remarries a stern bishop, Alexander and his sister Fanny are banished to a gothic world.\nDrawing heavily on Bergman’s own memories, it highlights the young protagonist’s fascination with storytelling, while also serving as a kind of confessional critique of his films and reworked themes, with trademark scenes of marital infighting, desperate grief, and searching existential enquiry.\nAlthough Bergman is as attuned as ever to the anguish of life, there is also much that is fondly recalled, from toy theatres and magic lantern shows to family Christmases and favoured relatives.",

The neighbours and the village are against them, and the family must muster all their strength and defiance to navigate the labyrinth of India's courts, amidst village disapproval, threats of violence and mounting tensions.\r\n\r\nWith tremendous access to all facets of this story, To Kill a Tiger is an astutely observed and courageous examination of societal misogyny, and a source of hope for survivors in India. Winning multiple awards at film festivals across the world including Toronto and Palm Springs, it show's how one family's strength can force a social reckoning that will reverberate for years to come.\r\n\r\nTo Kill a Tiger deals with highly sensitive subject matter and contains depictions of sexual violence, which may be triggering for some viewers.",

In Every Body, filmmaker Julie Cohen (RBG) meets three intersex people who have moved from childhoods marked by shame, secrecy and non-consensual surgeries, to thriving adulthoods after each decided to come out publicly as their authentic selves.\r\n\r\n\r\nActor and screenwriter River Gallo, political consultant Alicia Roth Weigel, and Ph.D. student Saifa Wall are now leaders in a global movement advocating for greater understanding of the intersex community. Cohen approaches this sensitive subject gently and yet with a real joy and enthusiasm for River, Alicia and Saifa, who are trailblazing a path of acceptance for the many people across the world born with sex characteristics that don't fit the binary notions of 'male' and 'female'. This is a compelling celebration of River, Alicia and Saifa, as well as a decisive call for equality.",

Wim Wenders creates a portrait of Anselm Kiefer, one of the most innovative and important painters and sculptors of our time, shot in 3D and 6K-resolution. \n\nThe film presents a total immersion in the artist’s work and practice which explores human existence and the cyclical nature of history, inspired by literature, poetry, philosophy, science, mythology and religion. For over two years, Wenders traced Kiefer’s path from his native Germany to his current home in France, connecting the stages of his life to the essential places of his career that spans more than five decades.\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: Due to an unexpected 3D glasses supply issue at Mayfair, all our Anselm 3D shows will likely be in 2D. We apologise for any inconvenience, as we work to solve the issue and get back to 3D shows as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nMayfair’s new 3D system requires special electronic 3D glasses that we intend to hand out to customers at each 3D performance. At all other venues, commonly used passive 3D glasses will be available to purchase for £1.50, or you can bring your own pair.\r\n\r\n2D performances are available at Soho, Bloomsbury, Hoxton, Richmond, Camden, Wimbledon and Knutsford.",

From lost phone numbers to mistaken addresses, alcoholism and a charming stray dog, the pair’s path to happiness is as bittersweet as it is ultimately delightful. \n\nShot through with Kaurismäki’s typically playful, idiosyncratic style and deadpan sense of humor, this tender romantic tragicomedy is both a loving tribute to the filmmaker’s beloved contemporaries and a timely reminder of the potency of movie-going from one of cinema’s living legends.

Cohen approaches this sensitive subject gently and yet with a real joy and enthusiasm for River, Alicia and Saifa, who are trailblazing a path of acceptance for the many people across the world born with sex characteristics that don't fit the binary notions of 'male' and 'female'. This is a compelling celebration of River, Alicia and Saifa, as well as a decisive call for equality.",

Wim Wenders creates a portrait of Anselm Kiefer, one of the most innovative and important painters and sculptors of our time, shot in 3D and 6K-resolution. \n\nThe film presents a total immersion in the artist’s work and practice which explores human existence and the cyclical nature of history, inspired by literature, poetry, philosophy, science, mythology and religion. For over two years, Wenders traced Kiefer’s path from his native Germany to his current home in France, connecting the stages of his life to the essential places of his career that spans more than five decades.\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: Due to an unexpected 3D glasses supply issue at Mayfair, all our Anselm 3D shows will likely be in 2D. We apologise for any inconvenience, as we work to solve the issue and get back to 3D shows as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nMayfair’s new 3D system requires special electronic 3D glasses that we intend to hand out to customers at each 3D performance. At all other venues, commonly used passive 3D glasses will be available to purchase for £1.50, or you can bring your own pair.\r\n\r\n2D performances are available at Soho, Bloomsbury, Hoxton, Richmond, Camden, Wimbledon and Knutsford.",

With his livelihood threatened, Snow is reluctantly assigned to mentor Lucy Gray Baird (Rachel Zegler), a tribute from the impoverished District 12. But after Lucy Gray’s charm captivates the audience of Panem, Snow sees an opportunity to shift their fates. With everything he has worked for hanging in the balance, Snow unites with Lucy Gray to turn the odds in their favor. Battling his instincts for both good and evil, Snow sets out on a race against time to survive and reveal if he will ultimately become a songbird or a snake.",

From lost phone numbers to mistaken addresses, alcoholism and a charming stray dog, the pair’s path to happiness is as bittersweet as it is ultimately delightful. \n\nShot through with Kaurismäki’s typically playful, idiosyncratic style and deadpan sense of humor, this tender romantic tragicomedy is both a loving tribute to the filmmaker’s beloved contemporaries and a timely reminder of the potency of movie-going from one of cinema’s living legends.

The neighbours and the village are against them, and the family must muster all their strength and defiance to navigate the labyrinth of India's courts, amidst village disapproval, threats of violence and mounting tensions.\r\n\r\nWith tremendous access to all facets of this story, To Kill a Tiger is an astutely observed and courageous examination of societal misogyny, and a source of hope for survivors in India. Winning multiple awards at film festivals across the world including Toronto and Palm Springs, it show's how one family's strength can force a social reckoning that will reverberate for years to come.\r\n\r\nTo Kill a Tiger deals with highly sensitive subject matter and contains depictions of sexual violence, which may be triggering for some viewers.",

Cohen approaches this sensitive subject gently and yet with a real joy and enthusiasm for River, Alicia and Saifa, who are trailblazing a path of acceptance for the many people across the world born with sex characteristics that don't fit the binary notions of 'male' and 'female'. This is a compelling celebration of River, Alicia and Saifa, as well as a decisive call for equality.",

Born in the northern coastal town of South Shields, she was driven by a fierce conviction to record the impact of Thatcher era de-industrialisation upon local communities. Her striking black and white photos convey a tenderness and intimacy that set her apart from her peers and her work would become a powerful record of a world decimated by a new and ruthless form of capitalism. .\r\n \r\nThe film follows Tish’s daughter Ella as she revisits key moments from her mother’s life and work. She is accompanied by people who remained close to Tish throughout her life, and who are committed to ensuring her remarkable legacy is recognised.\r\n",
