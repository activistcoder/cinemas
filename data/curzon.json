Determined to document the truth of the Nazi regime, and in spite of the odds stacked against female correspondents, Lee captured some of the most important images of World War II, for which she paid an enormous personal price.\nThe film is not a biopic, instead it explores the most significant decade of Lee Miller’s life. As a middle-aged woman, she refused to be remembered as a model and male artists’ muse. Lee Miller defied the expectations and rules of the time and travelled to Europe to report from the frontline. There, in part as a reaction to her own well-hidden trauma, she used her Rolleiflex camera to give a voice to the voiceless. What Lee captured on film in Dachau and\nthroughout Europe was shocking and horrific. Her photographs of the war, its victims and its consequences remain among the most significant and historically important of the Second World War. She changed war photography forever, but Lee paid an enormous personal price for what she witnessed and the stories she fought to tell.",

As we join him on his structured daily routine, a series of unexpected encounters gradually begin to reveal a hidden past that lies behind his otherwise content and harmonious life. \n\nCombining a refreshingly unstereotypical depiction of the Japanese capital with a soundtrack comprised of iconic hits from the 60s and 80s, this is a subtle, shimmering and ultimately life-affirming reflection on finding beauty in the everyday world around us. Japan’s entry for Best International Film at the 2024 Academy Awards.\n",

In this tense role play, they must respond to another Jan 6 insurrection, but this time with members of the US military defecting to support the losing Presidential candidate.\r\n\r\nPlaying out like a real-life political thriller, this expertly crafted hybrid doc is underpinned by fascinating analysis of the ever-gathering, disillusioned US far right, and the growing number of military personal joining their ranks. The scenario here is fictional, but the possibility feels urgently real.",

Our future World Powers will be those who control not oil, but food, and the grab for land, water and means of production is already under way.\r\n\r\nAs THE GRAB investigates, it all begins to bubble to the surface in real time. Global food prices have hit an all-time high, threatening chaos and violence. Meanwhile, Russia is using food as a weapon against the Ukrainians, and as a geopolitical tool to wield global power.\r\n\r\nDirector Gabriela Cowperthwaite combines hard-hitting journalism from The Center for Investigative Reporting with her compelling character-driven storytelling, taking us around the globe from Arizona to Zambia in this revelatory expose.\r\n",

His flatmate, junior doctor Bo (Rory Fleck Byrne) is also stressed to the point of burnout. But then, newcomer Conrad (Amir El-Masry) joins them, and – inspired by Conrad’s optimism and assurance – Aden takes it upon himself to find a new part to play.\n\nFull of pointed notes about an industry rife with prejudice and hypocrisy, In Camera deploys elements of surrealism and fantasy to trace how its young British-Asian protagonist’s sense of self is affected by the tokenism of a world he hopes to conquer. Candid and acidly funny, with an unsettling eye for the warped and bizarre, it’s a playful, stylish satire not just of showbiz but also the myriad absurdities of modern life, with a complex, supple central performance from rising star Rizwan.",

Determined to document the truth of the Nazi regime, and in spite of the odds stacked against female correspondents, Lee captured some of the most important images of World War II, for which she paid an enormous personal price.\nThe film is not a biopic, instead it explores the most significant decade of Lee Miller’s life. As a middle-aged woman, she refused to be remembered as a model and male artists’ muse. Lee Miller defied the expectations and rules of the time and travelled to Europe to report from the frontline. There, in part as a reaction to her own well-hidden trauma, she used her Rolleiflex camera to give a voice to the voiceless. What Lee captured on film in Dachau and\nthroughout Europe was shocking and horrific. Her photographs of the war, its victims and its consequences remain among the most significant and historically important of the Second World War. She changed war photography forever, but Lee paid an enormous personal price for what she witnessed and the stories she fought to tell.",

As we join him on his structured daily routine, a series of unexpected encounters gradually begin to reveal a hidden past that lies behind his otherwise content and harmonious life. \n\nCombining a refreshingly unstereotypical depiction of the Japanese capital with a soundtrack comprised of iconic hits from the 60s and 80s, this is a subtle, shimmering and ultimately life-affirming reflection on finding beauty in the everyday world around us.

His dysfunctional parents yell at him, his spiteful schoolteacher picks on him and luck just never goes his way. Despite his efforts at patience, one day it all becomes too much and Antoine throws in the towel, choosing to take his chances on the Paris streets. At times joyous and at others bitterly hard, his new life brings a newfound freedom – one that Antoine will follow up to its painful, poignant and beautiful conclusion.\n\nFrancois Truffaut's first feature film and arguably the starting point of the Nouvelle Vague, The 400 Blows is a true landmark in French cinema. Raw, honest, and intensely emotional, it captures youth in startlingly vivid detail and holds a mesmerising, unflinching mirror up to life itself.\r\n\r\nFrancois Truffaut's classic of the French New Wave played for over three months at Curzon Mayfair upon its UK release in 1960. His later films The Bride Wore Black, The Last Metro and Finally, Sunday! also played Mayfair on extended runs, the latter, and Truffaut's final movie, was released by Art Eye. ",

Candid and acidly funny, with an unsettling eye for the warped and bizarre, it’s a playful, stylish satire not just of showbiz but also the myriad absurdities of modern life, with a complex, supple central performance from rising star Rizwan.",

In 2008, facing a changing industry, Mr. Kim closed the business and offered to give  away his collection provided that it stay intact and be available to Kim’s Video members.\r\n\r\nKim eventually struck a deal, but not with a local institution, school, business or individual. Instead, he opted to send his entire rental collection over 4,000 miles away to the Italian  village of Salemi, Sicily. Enter filmmaker David Redmon, who credits Kim’s Video for his film education. Determined  to rent a movie from Kim’s Video in Sicily, Redmon embarks on a bizarre and increasingly  obsessive quest that takes him to Salemi, where he becomes entangled in a web of local  politics, and to South Korea, where he tracks down the enigmatic Mr. Kim in the hope of  influencing the collection’s future.  Playing with various filmic forms, from cine-essay and investigative nonfiction to  experimental cinema, Kim’s Video is an ode to the love of cinema and will strike a chord  with anyone who has ever rented a movie",

As a middle-aged woman, she refused to be remembered as a model and male artists’ muse. Lee Miller defied the expectations and rules of the time and travelled to Europe to report from the frontline. There, in part as a reaction to her own well-hidden trauma, she used her Rolleiflex camera to give a voice to the voiceless. What Lee captured on film in Dachau and\nthroughout Europe was shocking and horrific. Her photographs of the war, its victims and its consequences remain among the most significant and historically important of the Second World War. She changed war photography forever, but Lee paid an enormous personal price for what she witnessed and the stories she fought to tell.",

      "synopsis": "In collaboration with Fitzcarraldo Editions to commemorate the centenary of Janet Frame, and celebrate the publication of a new edition of Frame's novel, The Edge of the Alphabet, Curzon will be showing Jane Campion's biographical 1990 film, An Angel at My Table, based on Janet Frame's autobiography of the same name. Jane Campion’s second feature, her celebrated international breakthrough is a fascinating and emotionally charged portrait of writer Janet Frame.\r\nJanet Frame was due to undergo a lobotomy when her collection of short stories was awarded a national literary prize. Her work would become inextricably linked to her psychological health. In particular her three works of memoir, To the Is-Land (1982), An Angel at My Table(1984), and The Envoy from Mirror City (1984) which Jane Campion adapted into her second feature. Alexia Keogh, Karen Fergusson and Kerry Fox play Frame as a child, adolescent and adult, each sporting the shock of red hair that became a marked symbol of the writer’s uniqueness. Key to the film is the normalisation of mental illness. In Frames youth it was dealt with harshly; severe treatment was preferred to understanding. In contrast to such an austere environment is Frame’s spirit of endurance and the freedom her writing would eventually give her.\r\n\r\nFollowing her series of acclaimed shorts and debut feature Sweetie, An Angel at My Table cemented Campion’s position as one of contemporary cinema’s leading filmmakers. It’s a position she has maintained with The Piano and the recent The Power of the Dog. But this early film highlights just how fully formed her creative brilliance was so early in her career.\r\n\r\nThe film will be introduced the film's star Kerry Fox and academic Dr. Thirza Wakefield.",

Global food prices have hit an all-time high, threatening chaos and violence. Meanwhile, Russia is using food as a weapon against the Ukrainians, and as a geopolitical tool to wield global power.\r\n\r\nDirector Gabriela Cowperthwaite combines hard-hitting journalism from The Center for Investigative Reporting with her compelling character-driven storytelling, taking us around the globe from Arizona to Zambia in this revelatory expose.\r\n",

His flatmate, junior doctor Bo (Rory Fleck Byrne) is also stressed to the point of burnout. But then, newcomer Conrad (Amir El-Masry) joins them, and – inspired by Conrad’s optimism and assurance – Aden takes it upon himself to find a new part to play.\n\nFull of pointed notes about an industry rife with prejudice and hypocrisy, In Camera deploys elements of surrealism and fantasy to trace how its young British-Asian protagonist’s sense of self is affected by the tokenism of a world he hopes to conquer. Candid and acidly funny, with an unsettling eye for the warped and bizarre, it’s a playful, stylish satire not just of showbiz but also the myriad absurdities of modern life, with a complex, supple central performance from rising star Rizwan.",

Determined to document the truth of the Nazi regime, and in spite of the odds stacked against female correspondents, Lee captured some of the most important images of World War II, for which she paid an enormous personal price.\nThe film is not a biopic, instead it explores the most significant decade of Lee Miller’s life. As a middle-aged woman, she refused to be remembered as a model and male artists’ muse. Lee Miller defied the expectations and rules of the time and travelled to Europe to report from the frontline. There, in part as a reaction to her own well-hidden trauma, she used her Rolleiflex camera to give a voice to the voiceless. What Lee captured on film in Dachau and\nthroughout Europe was shocking and horrific. Her photographs of the war, its victims and its consequences remain among the most significant and historically important of the Second World War. She changed war photography forever, but Lee paid an enormous personal price for what she witnessed and the stories she fought to tell.",

As we join him on his structured daily routine, a series of unexpected encounters gradually begin to reveal a hidden past that lies behind his otherwise content and harmonious life. \n\nCombining a refreshingly unstereotypical depiction of the Japanese capital with a soundtrack comprised of iconic hits from the 60s and 80s, this is a subtle, shimmering and ultimately life-affirming reflection on finding beauty in the everyday world around us.

But then, newcomer Conrad (Amir El-Masry) joins them, and – inspired by Conrad’s optimism and assurance – Aden takes it upon himself to find a new part to play.\n\nFull of pointed notes about an industry rife with prejudice and hypocrisy, In Camera deploys elements of surrealism and fantasy to trace how its young British-Asian protagonist’s sense of self is affected by the tokenism of a world he hopes to conquer. Candid and acidly funny, with an unsettling eye for the warped and bizarre, it’s a playful, stylish satire not just of showbiz but also the myriad absurdities of modern life, with a complex, supple central performance from rising star Rizwan.",

One afternoon, tea with friends leads her to reassess her life and choices; she decides to break her solitary routine and revitalise her love life. On a chance outing, where she witnesses an encounter between a woman and the morality police and decides to intervene, she comes across a lonely taxi driver called Esmail (Esmail Mehrabi).  A newfound determination and confidence propels her to approach him, and she invites him over to her house in a bid for connection. What follows is an unpredictable, unforgettable evening. \n",

Determined to document the truth of the Nazi regime, and in spite of the odds stacked against female correspondents, Lee captured some of the most important images of World War II, for which she paid an enormous personal price.\nThe film is not a biopic, instead it explores the most significant decade of Lee Miller’s life. As a middle-aged woman, she refused to be remembered as a model and male artists’ muse. Lee Miller defied the expectations and rules of the time and travelled to Europe to report from the frontline. There, in part as a reaction to her own well-hidden trauma, she used her Rolleiflex camera to give a voice to the voiceless. What Lee captured on film in Dachau and\nthroughout Europe was shocking and horrific. Her photographs of the war, its victims and its consequences remain among the most significant and historically important of the Second World War. She changed war photography forever, but Lee paid an enormous personal price for what she witnessed and the stories she fought to tell.",

Determined to document the truth of the Nazi regime, and in spite of the odds stacked against female correspondents, Lee captured some of the most important images of World War II, for which she paid an enormous personal price.\nThe film is not a biopic, instead it explores the most significant decade of Lee Miller’s life. As a middle-aged woman, she refused to be remembered as a model and male artists’ muse. Lee Miller defied the expectations and rules of the time and travelled to Europe to report from the frontline. There, in part as a reaction to her own well-hidden trauma, she used her Rolleiflex camera to give a voice to the voiceless. What Lee captured on film in Dachau and\nthroughout Europe was shocking and horrific. Her photographs of the war, its victims and its consequences remain among the most significant and historically important of the Second World War. She changed war photography forever, but Lee paid an enormous personal price for what she witnessed and the stories she fought to tell.",

Horrified and grieving, but forced to deny it, Katherine finds herself fighting for her own survival. Conspiracy reverberates through the palace. Everyone holds their breath – for the queen to slip up, for Henry to take her head like wives before. With the hope for a future free of tyranny at risk, will Katherine submit to the inevitable for the sake of King and country? ",

      "synopsis": "A highly anticipated return to fiction feature filmmaking from Wim Wenders (Paris, Texas, Wings of Desire), PERFECT DAYS takes the writer-director to Tokyo to tell a story celebrating the hidden joys and minutiae of Japanese culture. Winner of the Best Actor award at Cannes 2023, Koji Yakusho (Babel, 13 Assassins) stars as Hirayama, a contemplative middle-aged man who lives a life of modesty and serenity, spending his days balancing his job as a dutiful caretaker of Tokyo’s numerous public toilets with his passion for music, literature and photography. As we join him on his structured daily routine, a series of unexpected encounters gradually begin to reveal a hidden past that lies behind his otherwise content and harmonious life. \n\nCombining a refreshingly unstereotypical depiction of the Japanese capital with a soundtrack comprised of iconic hits from the 60s and 80s, this is a subtle, shimmering and ultimately life-affirming reflection on finding beauty in the everyday world around us. Japan’s entry for Best International Film at the 2024 Academy Awards.\n",

His flatmate, junior doctor Bo (Rory Fleck Byrne) is also stressed to the point of burnout. But then, newcomer Conrad (Amir El-Masry) joins them, and – inspired by Conrad’s optimism and assurance – Aden takes it upon himself to find a new part to play.\n\nFull of pointed notes about an industry rife with prejudice and hypocrisy, In Camera deploys elements of surrealism and fantasy to trace how its young British-Asian protagonist’s sense of self is affected by the tokenism of a world he hopes to conquer. Candid and acidly funny, with an unsettling eye for the warped and bizarre, it’s a playful, stylish satire not just of showbiz but also the myriad absurdities of modern life, with a complex, supple central performance from rising star Rizwan.",

Meanwhile, Russia is using food as a weapon against the Ukrainians, and as a geopolitical tool to wield global power.\r\n\r\nDirector Gabriela Cowperthwaite combines hard-hitting journalism from The Center for Investigative Reporting with her compelling character-driven storytelling, taking us around the globe from Arizona to Zambia in this revelatory expose.\r\n",

As a middle-aged woman, she refused to be remembered as a model and male artists’ muse. Lee Miller defied the expectations and rules of the time and travelled to Europe to report from the frontline. There, in part as a reaction to her own well-hidden trauma, she used her Rolleiflex camera to give a voice to the voiceless. What Lee captured on film in Dachau and\nthroughout Europe was shocking and horrific. Her photographs of the war, its victims and its consequences remain among the most significant and historically important of the Second World War. She changed war photography forever, but Lee paid an enormous personal price for what she witnessed and the stories she fought to tell.",

As we join him on his structured daily routine, a series of unexpected encounters gradually begin to reveal a hidden past that lies behind his otherwise content and harmonious life. \n\nCombining a refreshingly unstereotypical depiction of the Japanese capital with a soundtrack comprised of iconic hits from the 60s and 80s, this is a subtle, shimmering and ultimately life-affirming reflection on finding beauty in the everyday world around us.

Candid and acidly funny, with an unsettling eye for the warped and bizarre, it’s a playful, stylish satire not just of showbiz but also the myriad absurdities of modern life, with a complex, supple central performance from rising star Rizwan.",

In 2008, facing a changing industry, Mr. Kim closed the business and offered to give  away his collection provided that it stay intact and be available to Kim’s Video members.\r\n\r\nKim eventually struck a deal, but not with a local institution, school, business or individual. Instead, he opted to send his entire rental collection over 4,000 miles away to the Italian  village of Salemi, Sicily. Enter filmmaker David Redmon, who credits Kim’s Video for his film education. Determined  to rent a movie from Kim’s Video in Sicily, Redmon embarks on a bizarre and increasingly  obsessive quest that takes him to Salemi, where he becomes entangled in a web of local  politics, and to South Korea, where he tracks down the enigmatic Mr. Kim in the hope of  influencing the collection’s future.  Playing with various filmic forms, from cine-essay and investigative nonfiction to  experimental cinema, Kim’s Video is an ode to the love of cinema and will strike a chord  with anyone who has ever rented a movie",
