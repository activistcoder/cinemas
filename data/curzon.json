With outstanding critical acclaim, The Holdovers is now the winner of 2 Golden Globes for Best Actor (Comedy) for Paul Giamatti and Best Supporting Actress for Da’Vine Joy Randolph.",

Eventually he forms an unlikely bond with one of them -- a damaged, brainy troublemaker (newcomer Dominic Sessa) -- and with the school’s head cook, who lost a son in Vietnam (Da’Vine Joy Randolph). With outstanding critical acclaim, The Holdovers is now the winner of 2 Golden Globes for Best Actor (Comedy) for Paul Giamatti and Best Supporting Actress for Da’Vine Joy Randolph.",

It is stories like these that have made this most remarkable director a cult figure the world over.\r\n\r\nThis comprehensive portrait by director Thomas von Steinaecke explores Herzog's work, process and everyday life, bringing together rare archive materials and in-depth interviews with the man himself, as well as celebrated collaborators - including Joshua Oppenheimer, Patti Smith, Christian Bale, Nicole Kidman and his wife, Lena Herzog.",

But both her methodology and her message came under criticism in the backlash from this popularity, and slowly but surely Shere was ridiculed and squeezed out of the mainstream - and eventually out of popular consciousness.\r\n\r\nDirector Nicole Newnham (Crip Camp) recovers Shere Hite from the margins of history, feminism and academia, exploring the charismatic former model's rise and fall from prominence. Using a treasure trove of archive footage, The Disappearance of Shere Hite transports viewers back to a time of great societal change and transformation around sexuality. It rediscovers a pioneer who has had an unmistakable influence on current conversations around gender and sexuality, and asks what led to Shere's erasure.",

But both her methodology and her message came under criticism in the backlash from this popularity, and slowly but surely Shere was ridiculed and squeezed out of the mainstream - and eventually out of popular consciousness.\r\n\r\nDirector Nicole Newnham (Crip Camp) recovers Shere Hite from the margins of history, feminism and academia, exploring the charismatic former model's rise and fall from prominence. Using a treasure trove of archive footage, The Disappearance of Shere Hite transports viewers back to a time of great societal change and transformation around sexuality. It rediscovers a pioneer who has had an unmistakable influence on current conversations around gender and sexuality, and asks what led to Shere's erasure.",

The most heavily monitored country in the world experiences huge infringements of privacy, (self-)censorship and control, whilst systems such as 'social credit scoring' are being tested and deployed.\r\n\r\nChinese filmmaker Jialing Zhang - now living outside the country since co-directing 2019's One Child Nation - directed this eye-opening exposé remotely, with the support of filmmakers within China, who remain anonymous for their own safety.\r\n\r\nTaking China as a mirror, the film sounds an alarm about the increasing use of surveillance tools around the world - even in democratically run countries.

To prove his point, Monk uses a pen name to write an outlandish “Black” book of his own, a book that propels him to the heart of hypocrisy and the madness he claims to disdain.",

But both her methodology and her message came under criticism in the backlash from this popularity, and slowly but surely Shere was ridiculed and squeezed out of the mainstream - and eventually out of popular consciousness.\r\n\r\nDirector Nicole Newnham (Crip Camp) recovers Shere Hite from the margins of history, feminism and academia, exploring the charismatic former model's rise and fall from prominence. Using a treasure trove of archive footage, The Disappearance of Shere Hite transports viewers back to a time of great societal change and transformation around sexuality. It rediscovers a pioneer who has had an unmistakable influence on current conversations around gender and sexuality, and asks what led to Shere's erasure.",

Jeffrey Wright stars as Monk, a frustrated novelist who’s fed up with the establishment profiting from “Black” entertainment that relies on tired and offensive tropes. To prove his point, Monk uses a pen name to write an outlandish “Black” book of his own, a book that propels him to the heart of hypocrisy and the madness he claims to disdain.",

Around the turn of the millennium Lanre’s complex relationship to heroin was documented in two ground-breaking films Don’t Get High on Your Own Supply (1998) and Cold Turkey (2001).\r\n\r\nThis intensely intimate film follows Lanre as he faces his ultimate challenge, his own terminal illness. Using his extensive archive, Regan presents a tender, funny and deeply moving portrayal of friendship and collaboration; a bravely personal, living testament to one person’s life and work.",

      "synopsis": "In 1982, the best of friends and still teenagers - George Michael and Andrew Ridgeley as WHAM! set out to conquer the world. By June of 1986 they played their very last gig at Wembley Stadium having done exactly that.\n\nNow for the very first time, told in their own words, the amazing story of how in four years they dominated the charts around the world with timeless and classic pop songs. Hit after hit - Club Tropicana, Wake Me Up Before You Go Go, Freedom, I’m Your Man and of course Last Christmas.\n\nTheir time in the spotlight was white-hot, becoming the very first western pop act to play in China.\n\nIt was a time that both encapsulated and epitomised not just their youth, but also those of the many millions of fans that adored them.\n\nWith unprecedented access to both George and Andrew’s personal archive including remarkable and never-before-seen footage, alongside rare, candid and previously unheard interviews, WHAM! charts their incredible journey from school friends to superstars.",

      "synopsis": "The full extent of the surveillance state in China is revealed with breathtaking immediacy in this gripping film, which follows the stories of Chinese citizens who have been monitored, intimidated and manipulated by the State.\r\n\r\nTotal Trust is an unflinching look a system of unbridled state power combined with the advancing capacities of Big Data and AI technology. The most heavily monitored country in the world experiences huge infringements of privacy, (self-)censorship and control, whilst systems such as 'social credit scoring' are being tested and deployed.\r\n\r\nChinese filmmaker Jialing Zhang - now living outside the country since co-directing 2019's One Child Nation - directed this eye-opening exposé remotely, with the support of filmmakers within China, who remain anonymous for their own safety.\r\n\r\nTaking China as a mirror, the film sounds an alarm about the increasing use of surveillance tools around the world - even in democratically run countries. If this is the present, what does our future look like?",

But her own role in the developing movement has been neglected.\r\n\r\nA gorgeous film to watch, set to the soundtrack of Miúcha's music and saturated with Bossa Nova vibes, Miúcha: The Voice of Bossa Nova tells her story through 16mm home movies, diaries, personal letters and her own expressive watercolour paintings, animated for the film.\r\n\r\nEven as she struggled to find her own voice in the shadow of her revered husband, Miúcha went on to earn unprecedented success, becoming a symbol of female resilience and a musical legend.",
