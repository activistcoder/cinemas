      "synopsis": "A heart-swelling, hand-drawn delight that invites audiences of all ages to explore love and loss through its tender portrait of a new friendship. Part of the Official Selection of the 2023 Cannes Film Festival, Oscar-nominated Robot Dreams is the first animated film from Pablo Berger (Blancanieves).\n\nDog is lonely. He spends a lot of time by himself, whiling away long evenings in his Manhattan studio apartment, eating microwave meals for one in front of the TV. Tired of his solitary existence, he decides to purchase a friend. When his order arrives, he builds Robot, a fun-loving, happy-go-lucky companion to keep him company. Dog and Robot spend an idyllic day together – frolicking through the city to the joyful melody of Earth, Wind & Fire’s ‘September’ – ending up at Coney Island to enjoy the fun. But they are soon separated on the beach. Dog, devastated at the loss of his friend, does everything in his power to get Robot back.  \n\nSet in the 1980s, vivified by a poppy soundtrack and a strong affinity for cinema history, Robot Dreams is a deeply felt, bittersweet buddy comedy that embraces ambiguity and the uncertainty of life’s path.\n",

As we join him on his structured daily routine, a series of unexpected encounters gradually begin to reveal a hidden past that lies behind his otherwise content and harmonious life. \n\nCombining a refreshingly unstereotypical depiction of the Japanese capital with a soundtrack comprised of iconic hits from the 60s and 80s, this is a subtle, shimmering and ultimately life-affirming reflection on finding beauty in the everyday world around us.

Part of the Official Selection of the 2023 Cannes Film Festival, Oscar-nominated Robot Dreams is the first animated film from Pablo Berger (Blancanieves).\n\nDog is lonely. He spends a lot of time by himself, whiling away long evenings in his Manhattan studio apartment, eating microwave meals for one in front of the TV. Tired of his solitary existence, he decides to purchase a friend. When his order arrives, he builds Robot, a fun-loving, happy-go-lucky companion to keep him company. Dog and Robot spend an idyllic day together – frolicking through the city to the joyful melody of Earth, Wind & Fire’s ‘September’ – ending up at Coney Island to enjoy the fun. But they are soon separated on the beach. Dog, devastated at the loss of his friend, does everything in his power to get Robot back.  \n\nSet in the 1980s, vivified by a poppy soundtrack and a strong affinity for cinema history, Robot Dreams is a deeply felt, bittersweet buddy comedy that embraces ambiguity and the uncertainty of life’s path.\n",

Winner of the Best Actor award at Cannes 2023, Koji Yakusho (Babel, 13 Assassins) stars as Hirayama, a contemplative middle-aged man who lives a life of modesty and serenity, spending his days balancing his job as a dutiful caretaker of Tokyo’s numerous public toilets with his passion for music, literature and photography. As we join him on his structured daily routine, a series of unexpected encounters gradually begin to reveal a hidden past that lies behind his otherwise content and harmonious life. \n\nCombining a refreshingly unstereotypical depiction of the Japanese capital with a soundtrack comprised of iconic hits from the 60s and 80s, this is a subtle, shimmering and ultimately life-affirming reflection on finding beauty in the everyday world around us. Japan’s entry for Best International Film at the 2024 Academy Awards.\n",

However, as the town's women - led by Police Officer Gladys Moss (Anjana Vasan) - begin to investigate the crime themselves, they suspect that something is amiss, and Rose may not be the culprit after all.",

As he recalls the progress of the movement, he reunites with friends and former activists, together questioning what has been achieved, twenty years on.\r\n\r\nThis new 4K restoration of I Heard It Through The Grapevine brings James Baldwin back to the screen in his centenary year. While co-directors Dick Fontaine, who passed away in October 2023, and Pat Hartley deftly interweave archive footage, they never stray far from the guiding intellect of Baldwin. The result is an intimate and emotionally charged journey, raising questions that resonate ever louder through the passing decades.\r\n\r\nRestored by Harvard Film Archive.

He spends a lot of time by himself, whiling away long evenings in his Manhattan studio apartment, eating microwave meals for one in front of the TV. Tired of his solitary existence, he decides to purchase a friend. When his order arrives, he builds Robot, a fun-loving, happy-go-lucky companion to keep him company. Dog and Robot spend an idyllic day together – frolicking through the city to the joyful melody of Earth, Wind & Fire’s ‘September’ – ending up at Coney Island to enjoy the fun. But they are soon separated on the beach. Dog, devastated at the loss of his friend, does everything in his power to get Robot back.  \n\nSet in the 1980s, vivified by a poppy soundtrack and a strong affinity for cinema history, Robot Dreams is a deeply felt, bittersweet buddy comedy that embraces ambiguity and the uncertainty of life’s path.\n",

Winner of the Best Actor award at Cannes 2023, Koji Yakusho (Babel, 13 Assassins) stars as Hirayama, a contemplative middle-aged man who lives a life of modesty and serenity, spending his days balancing his job as a dutiful caretaker of Tokyo’s numerous public toilets with his passion for music, literature and photography. As we join him on his structured daily routine, a series of unexpected encounters gradually begin to reveal a hidden past that lies behind his otherwise content and harmonious life. \n\nCombining a refreshingly unstereotypical depiction of the Japanese capital with a soundtrack comprised of iconic hits from the 60s and 80s, this is a subtle, shimmering and ultimately life-affirming reflection on finding beauty in the everyday world around us. Japan’s entry for Best International Film at the 2024 Academy Awards.\n",

One day, the village inhabitants become aware of a plan to build a glamping site near Takumi’s house; offering city residents a comfortable ‘escape’ to nature. When two company representatives from Tokyo arrive in the village to hold a meeting, it becomes clear that the project will have a negative impact on the local water supply, causing unrest. The agency’s mismatched intentions endanger both the ecological balance of the nature plateau and their way of life, with an aftermath that affects Takumi’s life deeply.\n\nFrom the director of Oscar® and BAFTA winner Drive My Car.",

The government is challenging existing structures by implementing a new police reform, which presents some new issues in rural communities where there is a lack of officers. In Stara Zburievka, On the mayor's initiative, people chose two local men, both retired policemen, Victor and Volodya, and gave them power to take care of the public order, as well as a car, and named them “sheriffs”.\r\n\r\nFollowing Viktor and Volodya on their everyday duties - involving stolen ducks and drunken neighbours - Ukrainian Sheriffs gives us a look beyond the war and the ongoing political events inside the everyday life of the villagers, foregrounding the tension between personal survival and political justice.\r\n\r\nWhat was meant to be a film about a few people from the Ukrainian countryside and their everyday struggles, arising mainly from prevalent unemployment, poverty, and illiteracy, at the end portrays the faith of a whole nation during the turning period in its history.",

There, he encounters a mysterious woman who will transform his life forever.\n\nThe latest from Argentinian writer-director Rodrigo Moreno, THE DELINQUENTS melds the existential and the playful to explore the nature of freedom itself.

Part of the Official Selection of the 2023 Cannes Film Festival, Oscar-nominated Robot Dreams is the first animated film from Pablo Berger (Blancanieves).\n\nDog is lonely. He spends a lot of time by himself, whiling away long evenings in his Manhattan studio apartment, eating microwave meals for one in front of the TV. Tired of his solitary existence, he decides to purchase a friend. When his order arrives, he builds Robot, a fun-loving, happy-go-lucky companion to keep him company. Dog and Robot spend an idyllic day together – frolicking through the city to the joyful melody of Earth, Wind & Fire’s ‘September’ – ending up at Coney Island to enjoy the fun. But they are soon separated on the beach. Dog, devastated at the loss of his friend, does everything in his power to get Robot back.  \n\nSet in the 1980s, vivified by a poppy soundtrack and a strong affinity for cinema history, Robot Dreams is a deeply felt, bittersweet buddy comedy that embraces ambiguity and the uncertainty of life’s path.\n",

Winner of the Best Actor award at Cannes 2023, Koji Yakusho (Babel, 13 Assassins) stars as Hirayama, a contemplative middle-aged man who lives a life of modesty and serenity, spending his days balancing his job as a dutiful caretaker of Tokyo’s numerous public toilets with his passion for music, literature and photography. As we join him on his structured daily routine, a series of unexpected encounters gradually begin to reveal a hidden past that lies behind his otherwise content and harmonious life. \n\nCombining a refreshingly unstereotypical depiction of the Japanese capital with a soundtrack comprised of iconic hits from the 60s and 80s, this is a subtle, shimmering and ultimately life-affirming reflection on finding beauty in the everyday world around us. Japan’s entry for Best International Film at the 2024 Academy Awards.\n",

This collective portrait of Dakh Daughters, shot on stage, in dressing rooms and on the road, paints a picture of being an artist under extreme conditions of pain and loss, realizing that during the war a natural self-defense is creation - in terms of the art as well as motherhood.\r\n\r\nThe film shows revolution through the female gaze of the artists which gives it a particular humane perspective, celebrating life rather than heroic deeds. The film captured the inception of what is going on in Ukraine today - incredible unity of Ukrainian people standing against the Russian assault on Ukraine, Europe, the free world.",

As voluminous evidence — including physical artifacts like the butterfly-shaped shrapnel found in the bodies of the pilots — piled up, the lies denying reality only became more outlandish and incredible.\r\n\r\nIn a world where violence can only be defended by lies, and lies only maintained by violence, Iron Butterflies presents the truth of what happened to MH17, but also what was at stake by not confronting it. Director Roman Liubyi uses a wealth of visual material and individual testimonies to craft this artful yet evidence-driven examination of a turning point in recent world history.\r\n\r\nThis act of mass murder not only destroyed so many people’s lives and the possible future that they could have built — it contained the seeds of the future we now live in.",

He spends a lot of time by himself, whiling away long evenings in his Manhattan studio apartment, eating microwave meals for one in front of the TV. Tired of his solitary existence, he decides to purchase a friend. When his order arrives, he builds Robot, a fun-loving, happy-go-lucky companion to keep him company. Dog and Robot spend an idyllic day together – frolicking through the city to the joyful melody of Earth, Wind & Fire’s ‘September’ – ending up at Coney Island to enjoy the fun. But they are soon separated on the beach. Dog, devastated at the loss of his friend, does everything in his power to get Robot back.  \n\nSet in the 1980s, vivified by a poppy soundtrack and a strong affinity for cinema history, Robot Dreams is a deeply felt, bittersweet buddy comedy that embraces ambiguity and the uncertainty of life’s path.\n",

As we join him on his structured daily routine, a series of unexpected encounters gradually begin to reveal a hidden past that lies behind his otherwise content and harmonious life. \n\nCombining a refreshingly unstereotypical depiction of the Japanese capital with a soundtrack comprised of iconic hits from the 60s and 80s, this is a subtle, shimmering and ultimately life-affirming reflection on finding beauty in the everyday world around us. Japan’s entry for Best International Film at the 2024 Academy Awards.\n",

      "synopsis": "Beguiling and unpredictable, Cannes Un Certain Regard breakout THE DELINQUENTS reinvents the heist film as a free-flowing adventure like no other.\n\nBuenos Aires bank employee Morán (Daniel Eliás) dreams up a scheme to liberate himself from corporate monotony: he’ll steal enough money to support a modest retirement, then confess and serve prison time while his co-worker holds on to the cash.\n\nSoon under pressure by a company investigator, accomplice Román (Esteban Bigliardi) heads to a remote rural idyll to hide the funds. There, he encounters a mysterious woman who will transform his life forever.\n\nThe latest from Argentinian writer-director Rodrigo Moreno, THE DELINQUENTS melds the existential and the playful to explore the nature of freedom itself. Suffused with timeless beauty, this cinematic discovery is at turns surreal, relatable, funny, romantic, surprising, restorative – and above all – a delight.",

For each of them, the stage is a platform to express their grief and trauma through the famous question, “to be or not to be,” a dilemma that applies to their own lives. The protagonists fight against disappointment, powerlessness, and anger, trying to put their lives back in order while processing their painful past. The rehearsals for the play are combined with an intense glimpse into the characters’ lives: a powerful portrait of a generation coping with the trauma of war which now, after Russia invades Ukraine, is their present and future alike.",

Part of the Official Selection of the 2023 Cannes Film Festival, Oscar-nominated Robot Dreams is the first animated film from Pablo Berger (Blancanieves).\n\nDog is lonely. He spends a lot of time by himself, whiling away long evenings in his Manhattan studio apartment, eating microwave meals for one in front of the TV. Tired of his solitary existence, he decides to purchase a friend. When his order arrives, he builds Robot, a fun-loving, happy-go-lucky companion to keep him company. Dog and Robot spend an idyllic day together – frolicking through the city to the joyful melody of Earth, Wind & Fire’s ‘September’ – ending up at Coney Island to enjoy the fun. But they are soon separated on the beach. Dog, devastated at the loss of his friend, does everything in his power to get Robot back.  \n\nSet in the 1980s, vivified by a poppy soundtrack and a strong affinity for cinema history, Robot Dreams is a deeply felt, bittersweet buddy comedy that embraces ambiguity and the uncertainty of life’s path.\n",

Winner of the Best Actor award at Cannes 2023, Koji Yakusho (Babel, 13 Assassins) stars as Hirayama, a contemplative middle-aged man who lives a life of modesty and serenity, spending his days balancing his job as a dutiful caretaker of Tokyo’s numerous public toilets with his passion for music, literature and photography. As we join him on his structured daily routine, a series of unexpected encounters gradually begin to reveal a hidden past that lies behind his otherwise content and harmonious life. \n\nCombining a refreshingly unstereotypical depiction of the Japanese capital with a soundtrack comprised of iconic hits from the 60s and 80s, this is a subtle, shimmering and ultimately life-affirming reflection on finding beauty in the everyday world around us. Japan’s entry for Best International Film at the 2024 Academy Awards.\n",

When Edith and fellow residents begin to receive wicked letters full of unintentionally hilarious profanities, foulmouthed Rose is charged with the crime.

One day, the village inhabitants become aware of a plan to build a glamping site near Takumi’s house; offering city residents a comfortable ‘escape’ to nature. When two company representatives from Tokyo arrive in the village to hold a meeting, it becomes clear that the project will have a negative impact on the local water supply, causing unrest. The agency’s mismatched intentions endanger both the ecological balance of the nature plateau and their way of life, with an aftermath that affects Takumi’s life deeply.\n\nFrom the director of Oscar® and BAFTA winner Drive My Car.",

Part of the Official Selection of the 2023 Cannes Film Festival, Oscar-nominated Robot Dreams is the first animated film from Pablo Berger (Blancanieves).\n\nDog is lonely. He spends a lot of time by himself, whiling away long evenings in his Manhattan studio apartment, eating microwave meals for one in front of the TV. Tired of his solitary existence, he decides to purchase a friend. When his order arrives, he builds Robot, a fun-loving, happy-go-lucky companion to keep him company. Dog and Robot spend an idyllic day together – frolicking through the city to the joyful melody of Earth, Wind & Fire’s ‘September’ – ending up at Coney Island to enjoy the fun. But they are soon separated on the beach. Dog, devastated at the loss of his friend, does everything in his power to get Robot back.  \n\nSet in the 1980s, vivified by a poppy soundtrack and a strong affinity for cinema history, Robot Dreams is a deeply felt, bittersweet buddy comedy that embraces ambiguity and the uncertainty of life’s path.\n",

The mixed programme concludes with Requiem, his 1976 work for Stuttgart Ballet, created in memory of its late artistic director, MacMillan’s friend and former Royal Ballet dancer and choreographer John Cranko.

As we join him on his structured daily routine, a series of unexpected encounters gradually begin to reveal a hidden past that lies behind his otherwise content and harmonious life. \n\nCombining a refreshingly unstereotypical depiction of the Japanese capital with a soundtrack comprised of iconic hits from the 60s and 80s, this is a subtle, shimmering and ultimately life-affirming reflection on finding beauty in the everyday world around us. Japan’s entry for Best International Film at the 2024 Academy Awards.\n",

When two company representatives from Tokyo arrive in the village to hold a meeting, it becomes clear that the project will have a negative impact on the local water supply, causing unrest. The agency’s mismatched intentions endanger both the ecological balance of the nature plateau and their way of life, with an aftermath that affects Takumi’s life deeply.\n\nFrom the director of Oscar® and BAFTA winner Drive My Car.",

      "synopsis": "A heart-swelling, hand-drawn delight that invites audiences of all ages to explore love and loss through its tender portrait of a new friendship. Part of the Official Selection of the 2023 Cannes Film Festival, Oscar-nominated Robot Dreams is the first animated film from Pablo Berger (Blancanieves).\n\nDog is lonely. He spends a lot of time by himself, whiling away long evenings in his Manhattan studio apartment, eating microwave meals for one in front of the TV. Tired of his solitary existence, he decides to purchase a friend. When his order arrives, he builds Robot, a fun-loving, happy-go-lucky companion to keep him company. Dog and Robot spend an idyllic day together – frolicking through the city to the joyful melody of Earth, Wind & Fire’s ‘September’ – ending up at Coney Island to enjoy the fun. But they are soon separated on the beach. Dog, devastated at the loss of his friend, does everything in his power to get Robot back.  \n\nSet in the 1980s, vivified by a poppy soundtrack and a strong affinity for cinema history, Robot Dreams is a deeply felt, bittersweet buddy comedy that embraces ambiguity and the uncertainty of life’s path.\n",

Winner of the Best Actor award at Cannes 2023, Koji Yakusho (Babel, 13 Assassins) stars as Hirayama, a contemplative middle-aged man who lives a life of modesty and serenity, spending his days balancing his job as a dutiful caretaker of Tokyo’s numerous public toilets with his passion for music, literature and photography. As we join him on his structured daily routine, a series of unexpected encounters gradually begin to reveal a hidden past that lies behind his otherwise content and harmonious life. \n\nCombining a refreshingly unstereotypical depiction of the Japanese capital with a soundtrack comprised of iconic hits from the 60s and 80s, this is a subtle, shimmering and ultimately life-affirming reflection on finding beauty in the everyday world around us. Japan’s entry for Best International Film at the 2024 Academy Awards.\n",

From Oscar- and BAFTA-winning filmmaker and Turner Prize-winning visual artist Steve McQueen, comes this mesmerising and monumental excavation of how the past haunts our precarious present: mirroring it and warning us in plain sight.\r\n\r\nInformed by the book Atlas of an Occupied City: Amsterdam 1940-1945 written by Bianca Stigter, the documentary creates two interlocking portraits. One shows the city’s devastating Nazi occupation through door-to-door accounts – tales of Jewish persecution, of resistance, collaboration, valour, and denial. The other is a vivid journey through the last years of pandemic and protest. The combination has a transformative effect with which McQueen opens up a poetic, dreamlike space where unthinkable history and hope for a new future co-exist.",

There, he encounters a mysterious woman who will transform his life forever.\n\nThe latest from Argentinian writer-director Rodrigo Moreno, THE DELINQUENTS melds the existential and the playful to explore the nature of freedom itself. Suffused with timeless beauty, this cinematic discovery is at turns surreal, relatable, funny, romantic, surprising, restorative – and above all – a delight.",

Travelling to Goya’s key places, diving into his abundant work, Carrière leads us through a personal exploration of a painter who anticipated modernity both in his subject matter and in his form.\r\n\r\nPersonal memories abound, as Carrière recalls his work with Buñuel and traces the lines of surrealism and inspiration between these artists, conjuring ghosts and providing a rich and rewarding insight into the painter, and those who came after him.",
