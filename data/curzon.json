Wim Wenders creates a portrait of Anselm Kiefer, one of the most innovative and important painters and sculptors of our time, shot in 3D and 6K-resolution. \n\nThe film presents a total immersion in the artist’s work and practice which explores human existence and the cyclical nature of history, inspired by literature, poetry, philosophy, science, mythology and religion. For over two years, Wenders traced Kiefer’s path from his native Germany to his current home in France, connecting the stages of his life to the essential places of his career that spans more than five decades.\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: Due to an unexpected 3D glasses supply issue at Mayfair, all our Anselm 3D shows will likely be in 2D. We apologise for any inconvenience, as we work to solve the issue and get back to 3D shows as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nMayfair’s new 3D system requires special electronic 3D glasses that we intend to hand out to customers at each 3D performance. At all other venues, commonly used passive 3D glasses will be available to purchase for £1.50, or you can bring your own pair.\r\n\r\n2D performances are available at Soho, Bloomsbury, Hoxton, Richmond, Camden, Wimbledon and Knutsford.",

However, this is no easy feat as, increasingly, many sensationalise criticism of the Modi government as treason. With fervent nationalism on the rise, dissidents are labelled as enemies of India, with their lives and livelihoods viciously attacked. With budget cuts, mass resignations and mounting death threats, can Kumar persevere in the face of adversity? While We Watched is a riveting tale of truth, courage and journalistic integrity. Kumar’s unyielding spirit is captured brilliantly, and we watch as he faces seemingly unending challenges. With factual reporting in international crisis, director Vinay Shukla trains his lens on a beleaguered lone voice, providing us with hope that there are still determined forces dedicated to speaking truth to power.\"",

      "synopsis": "A moving portrait of social documentary photographer and trailblazer Tish Murtha, who dedicated her life to documenting the lives of working-class communities in North East England.\r\n \r\nPaul Sng’s powerful film celebrates the work of Murtha and her commitment to fighting for the communities like the one she grew up in. Born in the northern coastal town of South Shields, she was driven by a fierce conviction to record the impact of Thatcher era de-industrialisation upon local communities. Her striking black and white photos convey a tenderness and intimacy that set her apart from her peers and her work would become a powerful record of a world decimated by a new and ruthless form of capitalism. .\r\n \r\nThe film follows Tish’s daughter Ella as she revisits key moments from her mother’s life and work. She is accompanied by people who remained close to Tish throughout her life, and who are committed to ensuring her remarkable legacy is recognised.\r\n",

It’s one story representing a huge groundswell of people rediscovering the joys of making. Actor Mark Rylance called the film “Exquisite and inspiring, beautiful and helpful for anyone suffering loss or grief”.",

Puss has burned through eight of his nine lives, though he lost count along the way. Getting those lives back will send Puss in Boots on his grandest quest yet.\n\nAcademy Award® nominee Antonio Banderas returns as the voice of the notorious PiB as he embarks on an epic journey into the Black Forest to find the mythical Wishing Star and restore his lost lives. But with only one life left, Puss will have to humble himself and ask for help from his former partner and nemesis: the captivating Kitty Soft Paws (Oscar® nominee Salma Hayek).\n\nIn their quest, Puss and Kitty will be aided—against their better judgment—by a ratty, chatty, relentlessly cheerful mutt, Perro (Harvey Guillén, What We Do in the Shadows). Together, our trio of heroes will have to stay one step ahead of Goldilocks (Oscar® nominee Florence Pugh, Black Widow) and the Three Bears Crime Family, “Big” Jack Horner (Emmy winner John Mulaney, Big Mouth) and terrifying bounty hunter, The Big Bad Wolf (Wagner Moura, Narcos).",

      "synopsis": "Latif al-Ani, the beloved 'father of Iraqi photography', captured his country in its heyday from the 1950s to 1970s. When Saddam Hussein took power, al-Ani put down his camera. His photographs form a unique archive showing a cosmopolitan Iraq, before the devastation of war, that many Westerners and even Iraqi people themselves have never seen.\r\n\r\nIn Iraq's Invisible Beauty, 86-year-old al-Ani travels across his devastated homeland, accompanied by Belgian-Kurdish filmmaker Sahim Omar Kalifa, in search of the places he once knew and captured on film. On this final trip, he shows his photographs to the people he meets, who cannot believe the vibrant and prosperous Iraq he presents to them.\r\n\r\nAl-Ani died in 2021, soon after the completion of this film, which forms a moving tribute to the great photographer and the country he lost.\r\n",

Kumar and his team at NDTV fight tirelessly to report on the stories overlooked by pro-government mainstream media. However, this is no easy feat as, increasingly, many sensationalise criticism of the Modi government as treason. With fervent nationalism on the rise, dissidents are labelled as enemies of India, with their lives and livelihoods viciously attacked. With budget cuts, mass resignations and mounting death threats, can Kumar persevere in the face of adversity? While We Watched is a riveting tale of truth, courage and journalistic integrity. Kumar’s unyielding spirit is captured brilliantly, and we watch as he faces seemingly unending challenges. With factual reporting in international crisis, director Vinay Shukla trains his lens on a beleaguered lone voice, providing us with hope that there are still determined forces dedicated to speaking truth to power.\"",
