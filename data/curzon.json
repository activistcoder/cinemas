With his livelihood threatened, Snow is reluctantly assigned to mentor Lucy Gray Baird (Rachel Zegler), a tribute from the impoverished District 12. But after Lucy Gray’s charm captivates the audience of Panem, Snow sees an opportunity to shift their fates. With everything he has worked for hanging in the balance, Snow unites with Lucy Gray to turn the odds in their favor. Battling his instincts for both good and evil, Snow sets out on a race against time to survive and reveal if he will ultimately become a songbird or a snake.",

From lost phone numbers to mistaken addresses, alcoholism and a charming stray dog, the pair’s path to happiness is as bittersweet as it is ultimately delightful. \n\nShot through with Kaurismäki’s typically playful, idiosyncratic style and deadpan sense of humor, this tender romantic tragicomedy is both a loving tribute to the filmmaker’s beloved contemporaries and a timely reminder of the potency of movie-going from one of cinema’s living legends.

With his livelihood threatened, Snow is reluctantly assigned to mentor Lucy Gray Baird (Rachel Zegler), a tribute from the impoverished District 12. But after Lucy Gray’s charm captivates the audience of Panem, Snow sees an opportunity to shift their fates. With everything he has worked for hanging in the balance, Snow unites with Lucy Gray to turn the odds in their favor. Battling his instincts for both good and evil, Snow sets out on a race against time to survive and reveal if he will ultimately become a songbird or a snake.",

A young woman in her 20s, Therese Belivet (Rooney Mara), is a clerk working in a Manhattan department store and dreaming of a more fulfilling life when she meets Carol (Cate Blanchett), an alluring woman trapped in a loveless, convenient marriage. As an immediate connection sparks between them, the innocence of their first encounter dims and their connection deepens. While Carol breaks free from the confines of marriage, her husband (Kyle Chandler) begins to question her competence as a mother as her involvement with Therese and close relationship with her best friend Abby (Sarah Paulson) come to light.",

From lost phone numbers to mistaken addresses, alcoholism and a charming stray dog, the pair’s path to happiness is as bittersweet as it is ultimately delightful. \n\nShot through with Kaurismäki’s typically playful, idiosyncratic style and deadpan sense of humor, this tender romantic tragicomedy is both a loving tribute to the filmmaker’s beloved contemporaries and a timely reminder of the potency of movie-going from one of cinema’s living legends.

The next day dawns and, as if in a dream, everything is restored to normality. But Alexander must keep his vow.\n\nAmong many other awards, The Sacrifice won the Cannes Grand Prix in 1986, the same year that Tarkovsky died of cancer in Paris at the age of 54.",

With his livelihood threatened, Snow is reluctantly assigned to mentor Lucy Gray Baird (Rachel Zegler), a tribute from the impoverished District 12. But after Lucy Gray’s charm captivates the audience of Panem, Snow sees an opportunity to shift their fates. With everything he has worked for hanging in the balance, Snow unites with Lucy Gray to turn the odds in their favor. Battling his instincts for both good and evil, Snow sets out on a race against time to survive and reveal if he will ultimately become a songbird or a snake.",

From lost phone numbers to mistaken addresses, alcoholism and a charming stray dog, the pair’s path to happiness is as bittersweet as it is ultimately delightful. \n\nShot through with Kaurismäki’s typically playful, idiosyncratic style and deadpan sense of humor, this tender romantic tragicomedy is both a loving tribute to the filmmaker’s beloved contemporaries and a timely reminder of the potency of movie-going from one of cinema’s living legends.

Wim Wenders creates a portrait of Anselm Kiefer, one of the most innovative and important painters and sculptors of our time, shot in 3D and 6K-resolution. \n\nThe film presents a total immersion in the artist’s work and practice which explores human existence and the cyclical nature of history, inspired by literature, poetry, philosophy, science, mythology and religion. For over two years, Wenders traced Kiefer’s path from his native Germany to his current home in France, connecting the stages of his life to the essential places of his career that spans more than five decades.\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: Due to an unexpected 3D glasses supply issue at Mayfair, all our Anselm 3D shows will likely be in 2D. We apologise for any inconvenience, as we work to solve the issue and get back to 3D shows as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nMayfair’s new 3D system requires special electronic 3D glasses that we intend to hand out to customers at each 3D performance. At all other venues, commonly used passive 3D glasses will be available to purchase for £1.50, or you can bring your own pair.\r\n\r\n2D performances are available at Soho, Bloomsbury, Hoxton, Richmond, Camden, Wimbledon and Knutsford.",

Born in the northern coastal town of South Shields, she was driven by a fierce conviction to record the impact of Thatcher era de-industrialisation upon local communities. Her striking black and white photos convey a tenderness and intimacy that set her apart from her peers and her work would become a powerful record of a world decimated by a new and ruthless form of capitalism. .\r\n \r\nThe film follows Tish’s daughter Ella as she revisits key moments from her mother’s life and work. She is accompanied by people who remained close to Tish throughout her life, and who are committed to ensuring her remarkable legacy is recognised.\r\n",

Even at the age of six, Mozart was already famous as a prodigy, dragged around Europe by his dominating father Leopold, showing off musical tricks for the amusement of the aristocracy. Now, at 26, Mozart has become a composer, eager to present his abilities. Salieri hears him perform and is dismayed to discover that his is the most beautiful music he’s ever heard.\r\n\r\nWhen Salieri meets Mozart, the young man proceeds to insult him in a variety of ways. Envious of his junior’s talent, which throws his own mediocrity into sharp relief, Salieri does his best to curtail Mozart’s success, and plots to destroy him.",

For over two years, Wenders traced Kiefer’s path from his native Germany to his current home in France, connecting the stages of his life to the essential places of his career that spans more than five decades.\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: Due to an unexpected 3D glasses supply issue at Mayfair, all our Anselm 3D shows will likely be in 2D. We apologise for any inconvenience, as we work to solve the issue and get back to 3D shows as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nMayfair’s new 3D system requires special electronic 3D glasses that we intend to hand out to customers at each 3D performance. At all other venues, commonly used passive 3D glasses will be available to purchase for £1.50, or you can bring your own pair.\r\n\r\n2D performances are available at Soho, Bloomsbury, Hoxton, Richmond, Camden, Wimbledon and Knutsford.",
