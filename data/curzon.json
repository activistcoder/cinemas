She must call on the courage she never knew she had to free herself and return her family to the outside world. Combining Japanese mythology with \"Alice in Wonderland\"-type whimsy, \"Spirited Away\" cemented Miyazaki’s reputation as an icon of animation and storytelling. Dubbed in English on October 29 and subtitled on October 30, this special two-day event will also feature GKIDS Mini-Fest, an ongoing festival of the best animated shorts from around the world. ",

One shows the city’s devastating Nazi occupation through door-to-door accounts – tales of Jewish persecution, of resistance, collaboration, valour, and denial. The other is a vivid journey through the last years of pandemic and protest. The combination has a transformative effect with which McQueen opens up a poetic, dreamlike space where unthinkable history and hope for a new future co-exist.",

As he recalls the progress of the movement, he reunites with friends and former activists, together questioning what has been achieved, twenty years on.\r\n\r\nThis new 4K restoration of I Heard It Through The Grapevine brings James Baldwin back to the screen in his centenary year. While co-directors Dick Fontaine, who passed away in October 2023, and Pat Hartley deftly interweave archive footage, they never stray far from the guiding intellect of Baldwin. The result is an intimate and emotionally charged journey, raising questions that resonate ever louder through the passing decades.\r\n\r\nRestored by Harvard Film Archive. Special thanks to Gugulethu Mseleku, Smokey Fontaine, the late Dick Fontaine, and Pat Hartley.",

She must call on the courage she never knew she had to free herself and return her family to the outside world. Combining Japanese mythology with \"Alice in Wonderland\"-type whimsy, \"Spirited Away\" cemented Miyazaki’s reputation as an icon of animation and storytelling. Dubbed in English on October 29 and subtitled on October 30, this special two-day event will also feature GKIDS Mini-Fest, an ongoing festival of the best animated shorts from around the world. ",

THE BIBI FILES is a film about a man singularly focused on his own political survival in a region beset by war.\r\n\r\nLeaked footage from police interrogation videos are interwoven with archival footage that shows Netanyahu’s rise to power, and how his nearly 30-year rule as Prime Minister has divided the state of Israel. Interspersed throughout are interviews with prominent journalists, Israeli statesmen, Netanyahu's associates, and longtime friends, whose observations and anecdotes reveal a chilling portrait of a leader who, in his drive to evade justice, has aligned himself with radical right-wing extremists. Netanyahu’s fixation on his entitlement to remain Prime Minister has, in this way, led to political decisions that have endangered Israel’s safety, and destroyed her standing as a democracy in the Middle East.\r\n",

      "synopsis": "Originally released in 1982, I Heard it Through the Grapevine is not so much a portrait of the seminal writer James Baldwin, as a deep immersion into his own exploration of the American South, two decades on from the start of the Civil Rights Movement.\r\n\r\nTravelling across the country, Baldwin revisits the landmarks of the Civil Rights struggle and critical sites of resistance - Selma, Birmingham, Atlanta. As he recalls the progress of the movement, he reunites with friends and former activists, together questioning what has been achieved, twenty years on.\r\n\r\nThis new 4K restoration of I Heard It Through The Grapevine brings James Baldwin back to the screen in his centenary year. While co-directors Dick Fontaine, who passed away in October 2023, and Pat Hartley deftly interweave archive footage, they never stray far from the guiding intellect of Baldwin. The result is an intimate and emotionally charged journey, raising questions that resonate ever louder through the passing decades.\r\n\r\nRestored by Harvard Film Archive. Special thanks to Gugulethu Mseleku, Smokey Fontaine, the late Dick Fontaine, and Pat Hartley.",

This fly-on-the-wall film captures Ukrainians as they are forced to leave their homes and drive into the unknown.What does it look like to flee from a war? This gentle, yet painful, film explores the raw, human cost of conflict. Each new passenger, whether they’re women or men, young or old, individuals or families, has first-hand experience of the Russian invasion, and a spectrum of emotions surfaces in the car transporting them to safety. Children quietly read books, a woman weeps for the cow she’s left behind, others are lost for words… Amidst this tragedy, the chaos of conflict and upended lives, there are fleeting moments of humour and hope. And beyond the confines of the minibus, we witness the expanse of rural Ukraine – a vast landscape of natural beauty littered with the carnage of war, and the desolation and destruction of once populated communities.",

      "synopsis": "\r\nHayao Miyazaki’s Academy Award®-winning masterpiece \"Spirited Away\" was the biggest box office hit of all time in Japan and helped redefine the possibilities of animation for American audiences and a generation of new filmmakers. Chichiro thinks she is on another boring trip with her parents. But when they stop at a village that is not all that it seems, her parents undergo a mysterious transformation, and Chihiro is whisked into a world of fantastic spirits, shape-shifting dragons and a witch who never wants to see her leave. She must call on the courage she never knew she had to free herself and return her family to the outside world. Combining Japanese mythology with \"Alice in Wonderland\"-type whimsy, \"Spirited Away\" cemented Miyazaki’s reputation as an icon of animation and storytelling. Dubbed in English on October 29 and subtitled on October 30, this special two-day event will also feature GKIDS Mini-Fest, an ongoing festival of the best animated shorts from around the world. ",

Basel documents the gradual erasure of Masafer Yatta, as soldiers destroy the homes of families - the largest single act of forced transfer ever carried out in the occupied West Bank. He crosses paths with Yuval, an Israeli journalist who joins his struggle, and for over half a decade they fight against the expulsion while growing closer. Their complex bond is haunted by the extreme inequality between them: Basel, living under a brutal military occupation, and Yuval, unrestricted and free. \r\n\r\nThis film, by a Palestinian-Israeli collective of four young activists, was co-created during the darkest, most terrifying times in the region, as an act of creative resistance to Apartheid and a search for a path towards equality and justice.",

This fly-on-the-wall film captures Ukrainians as they are forced to leave their homes and drive into the unknown.What does it look like to flee from a war? This gentle, yet painful, film explores the raw, human cost of conflict. Each new passenger, whether they’re women or men, young or old, individuals or families, has first-hand experience of the Russian invasion, and a spectrum of emotions surfaces in the car transporting them to safety. Children quietly read books, a woman weeps for the cow she’s left behind, others are lost for words… Amidst this tragedy, the chaos of conflict and upended lives, there are fleeting moments of humour and hope. And beyond the confines of the minibus, we witness the expanse of rural Ukraine – a vast landscape of natural beauty littered with the carnage of war, and the desolation and destruction of once populated communities.",

From Oscar- and BAFTA-winning filmmaker and Turner Prize-winning visual artist Steve McQueen, comes this mesmerising and monumental excavation of how the past haunts our precarious present: mirroring it and warning us in plain sight.\r\n\r\nInformed by the book Atlas of an Occupied City: Amsterdam 1940-1945 written by Bianca Stigter, the documentary creates two interlocking portraits. One shows the city’s devastating Nazi occupation through door-to-door accounts – tales of Jewish persecution, of resistance, collaboration, valour, and denial. The other is a vivid journey through the last years of pandemic and protest. The combination has a transformative effect with which McQueen opens up a poetic, dreamlike space where unthinkable history and hope for a new future co-exist.",

She must call on the courage she never knew she had to free herself and return her family to the outside world. Combining Japanese mythology with \"Alice in Wonderland\"-type whimsy, \"Spirited Away\" cemented Miyazaki’s reputation as an icon of animation and storytelling.
