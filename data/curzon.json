From lost phone numbers to mistaken addresses, alcoholism and a charming stray dog, the pair’s path to happiness is as bittersweet as it is ultimately delightful. \n\nShot through with Kaurismäki’s typically playful, idiosyncratic style and deadpan sense of humor, this tender romantic tragicomedy is both a loving tribute to the filmmaker’s beloved contemporaries and a timely reminder of the potency of movie-going from one of cinema’s living legends.

For over two years, Wenders traced Kiefer’s path from his native Germany to his current home in France, connecting the stages of his life to the essential places of his career that spans more than five decades.\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: Due to an unexpected 3D glasses supply issue at Mayfair, all our Anselm 3D shows will likely be in 2D. We apologise for any inconvenience, as we work to solve the issue and get back to 3D shows as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nMayfair’s new 3D system requires special electronic 3D glasses that we intend to hand out to customers at each 3D performance. At all other venues, commonly used passive 3D glasses will be available to purchase for £1.50, or you can bring your own pair.\r\n\r\n2D performances are available at Soho, Bloomsbury, Hoxton, Richmond, Camden, Wimbledon and Knutsford.",

From lost phone numbers to mistaken addresses, alcoholism and a charming stray dog, the pair’s path to happiness is as bittersweet as it is ultimately delightful. \n\nShot through with Kaurismäki’s typically playful, idiosyncratic style and deadpan sense of humor, this tender romantic tragicomedy is both a loving tribute to the filmmaker’s beloved contemporaries and a timely reminder of the potency of movie-going from one of cinema’s living legends.

Wim Wenders creates a portrait of Anselm Kiefer, one of the most innovative and important painters and sculptors of our time, shot in 3D and 6K-resolution. \n\nThe film presents a total immersion in the artist’s work and practice which explores human existence and the cyclical nature of history, inspired by literature, poetry, philosophy, science, mythology and religion. For over two years, Wenders traced Kiefer’s path from his native Germany to his current home in France, connecting the stages of his life to the essential places of his career that spans more than five decades.\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: Due to an unexpected 3D glasses supply issue at Mayfair, all our Anselm 3D shows will likely be in 2D. We apologise for any inconvenience, as we work to solve the issue and get back to 3D shows as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nMayfair’s new 3D system requires special electronic 3D glasses that we intend to hand out to customers at each 3D performance. At all other venues, commonly used passive 3D glasses will be available to purchase for £1.50, or you can bring your own pair.\r\n\r\n2D performances are available at Soho, Bloomsbury, Hoxton, Richmond, Camden, Wimbledon and Knutsford.",

THE HUNGER GAMES: THE BALLAD OF SONGBIRDS & SNAKES follows a young Coriolanus (Tom Blyth) who is the last hope for his failing lineage, the once-proud Snow family that has fallen from grace in a post-war Capitol. With his livelihood threatened, Snow is reluctantly assigned to mentor Lucy Gray Baird (Rachel Zegler), a tribute from the impoverished District 12. But after Lucy Gray’s charm captivates the audience of Panem, Snow sees an opportunity to shift their fates. With everything he has worked for hanging in the balance, Snow unites with Lucy Gray to turn the odds in their favor. Battling his instincts for both good and evil, Snow sets out on a race against time to survive and reveal if he will ultimately become a songbird or a snake.",

From lost phone numbers to mistaken addresses, alcoholism and a charming stray dog, the pair’s path to happiness is as bittersweet as it is ultimately delightful. \n\nShot through with Kaurismäki’s typically playful, idiosyncratic style and deadpan sense of humor, this tender romantic tragicomedy is both a loving tribute to the filmmaker’s beloved contemporaries and a timely reminder of the potency of movie-going from one of cinema’s living legends.

      "synopsis": "For decades, the medical profession has told intersex people that they should keep quiet about their stories and their bodies, and the 'I' in LGBTQI is rarely acknowledged. In Every Body, filmmaker Julie Cohen (RBG) meets three intersex people who have moved from childhoods marked by shame, secrecy and non-consensual surgeries, to thriving adulthoods after each decided to come out publicly as their authentic selves.\r\n\r\n\r\nActor and screenwriter River Gallo, political consultant Alicia Roth Weigel, and Ph.D. student Saifa Wall are now leaders in a global movement advocating for greater understanding of the intersex community. Cohen approaches this sensitive subject gently and yet with a real joy and enthusiasm for River, Alicia and Saifa, who are trailblazing a path of acceptance for the many people across the world born with sex characteristics that don't fit the binary notions of 'male' and 'female'. This is a compelling celebration of River, Alicia and Saifa, as well as a decisive call for equality.",

Born in the northern coastal town of South Shields, she was driven by a fierce conviction to record the impact of Thatcher era de-industrialisation upon local communities. Her striking black and white photos convey a tenderness and intimacy that set her apart from her peers and her work would become a powerful record of a world decimated by a new and ruthless form of capitalism. .\r\n \r\nThe film follows Tish’s daughter Ella as she revisits key moments from her mother’s life and work. She is accompanied by people who remained close to Tish throughout her life, and who are committed to ensuring her remarkable legacy is recognised.\r\n",

THE HUNGER GAMES: THE BALLAD OF SONGBIRDS & SNAKES follows a young Coriolanus (Tom Blyth) who is the last hope for his failing lineage, the once-proud Snow family that has fallen from grace in a post-war Capitol. With his livelihood threatened, Snow is reluctantly assigned to mentor Lucy Gray Baird (Rachel Zegler), a tribute from the impoverished District 12. But after Lucy Gray’s charm captivates the audience of Panem, Snow sees an opportunity to shift their fates. With everything he has worked for hanging in the balance, Snow unites with Lucy Gray to turn the odds in their favor. Battling his instincts for both good and evil, Snow sets out on a race against time to survive and reveal if he will ultimately become a songbird or a snake.",

Wim Wenders creates a portrait of Anselm Kiefer, one of the most innovative and important painters and sculptors of our time, shot in 3D and 6K-resolution. \n\nThe film presents a total immersion in the artist’s work and practice which explores human existence and the cyclical nature of history, inspired by literature, poetry, philosophy, science, mythology and religion. For over two years, Wenders traced Kiefer’s path from his native Germany to his current home in France, connecting the stages of his life to the essential places of his career that spans more than five decades.\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: Due to an unexpected 3D glasses supply issue at Mayfair, all our Anselm 3D shows will likely be in 2D. We apologise for any inconvenience, as we work to solve the issue and get back to 3D shows as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nMayfair’s new 3D system requires special electronic 3D glasses that we intend to hand out to customers at each 3D performance. At all other venues, commonly used passive 3D glasses will be available to purchase for £1.50, or you can bring your own pair.\r\n\r\n2D performances are available at Soho, Bloomsbury, Hoxton, Richmond, Camden, Wimbledon and Knutsford.",

From lost phone numbers to mistaken addresses, alcoholism and a charming stray dog, the pair’s path to happiness is as bittersweet as it is ultimately delightful. \n\nShot through with Kaurismäki’s typically playful, idiosyncratic style and deadpan sense of humor, this tender romantic tragicomedy is both a loving tribute to the filmmaker’s beloved contemporaries and a timely reminder of the potency of movie-going from one of cinema’s living legends.

Cohen approaches this sensitive subject gently and yet with a real joy and enthusiasm for River, Alicia and Saifa, who are trailblazing a path of acceptance for the many people across the world born with sex characteristics that don't fit the binary notions of 'male' and 'female'. This is a compelling celebration of River, Alicia and Saifa, as well as a decisive call for equality.",

For over two years, Wenders traced Kiefer’s path from his native Germany to his current home in France, connecting the stages of his life to the essential places of his career that spans more than five decades.\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: Due to an unexpected 3D glasses supply issue at Mayfair, all our Anselm 3D shows will likely be in 2D. We apologise for any inconvenience, as we work to solve the issue and get back to 3D shows as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nMayfair’s new 3D system requires special electronic 3D glasses that we intend to hand out to customers at each 3D performance. At all other venues, commonly used passive 3D glasses will be available to purchase for £1.50, or you can bring your own pair.\r\n\r\n2D performances are available at Soho, Bloomsbury, Hoxton, Richmond, Camden, Wimbledon and Knutsford.",

From lost phone numbers to mistaken addresses, alcoholism and a charming stray dog, the pair’s path to happiness is as bittersweet as it is ultimately delightful. \n\nShot through with Kaurismäki’s typically playful, idiosyncratic style and deadpan sense of humor, this tender romantic tragicomedy is both a loving tribute to the filmmaker’s beloved contemporaries and a timely reminder of the potency of movie-going from one of cinema’s living legends.

Though he embraces this exciting new exploration, the novelty of being with a woman starts to fade when Martin begins an affair of his own, forcing Tomas to confront life decisions he may be unprepared – or unwilling – to deal with. \n\nPerceptive, intimate and unashamedly sexy, PASSAGES sees Sachs put a uniquely European spin on his usually tender style, telling a messy, modern love story that explores the complexities, contradictions and cruelties of sex and desire.",

      "synopsis": "Andrei Tarkovsky’s visionary final film unfolds in the hours before a nuclear holocaust. Erland Josephson, in an award-winning role, plays retired actor Alexander who is celebrating his birthday with family and friends when a crackly TV announcement warns of an imminent nuclear catastrophe.\n\nAlexander makes a promise to God that he will sacrifice all he holds dear, if the disaster can be averted. The next day dawns and, as if in a dream, everything is restored to normality. But Alexander must keep his vow.\n\nAmong many other awards, The Sacrifice won the Cannes Grand Prix in 1986, the same year that Tarkovsky died of cancer in Paris at the age of 54.",
