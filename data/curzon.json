As a middle-aged woman, she refused to be remembered as a model and male artists’ muse. Lee Miller defied the expectations and rules of the time and travelled to Europe to report from the frontline. There, in part as a reaction to her own well-hidden trauma, she used her Rolleiflex camera to give a voice to the voiceless. What Lee captured on film in Dachau and\nthroughout Europe was shocking and horrific. Her photographs of the war, its victims and its consequences remain among the most significant and historically important of the Second World War. She changed war photography forever, but Lee paid an enormous personal price for what she witnessed and the stories she fought to tell.",

In 2008, facing a changing industry, Mr. Kim closed the business and offered to give  away his collection provided that it stay intact and be available to Kim’s Video members.\r\n\r\nKim eventually struck a deal, but not with a local institution, school, business or individual. Instead, he opted to send his entire rental collection over 4,000 miles away to the Italian  village of Salemi, Sicily. Enter filmmaker David Redmon, who credits Kim’s Video for his film education. Determined  to rent a movie from Kim’s Video in Sicily, Redmon embarks on a bizarre and increasingly  obsessive quest that takes him to Salemi, where he becomes entangled in a web of local  politics, and to South Korea, where he tracks down the enigmatic Mr. Kim in the hope of  influencing the collection’s future.  Playing with various filmic forms, from cine-essay and investigative nonfiction to  experimental cinema, Kim’s Video is an ode to the love of cinema and will strike a chord  with anyone who has ever rented a movie",

All it takes is one injection and she is reborn – temporarily – as the gorgeous, twentysomething Sue (Margaret Qualley). \n\nThe only rule? Time needs to be split: exactly one week in one body, then one week in the other. No exceptions. A perfect balance. What could go wrong?\n\nDeliriously entertaining and ruthlessly satirical, Coralie Fargeat’s Cannes sensation turns toxic beauty culture inside out with a be-careful-what-you-wish-for fable for the ages. Explosive, provocative and twisted, THE SUBSTANCE marks the arrival of a thrillingly visionary filmmaker.\n",

As a middle-aged woman, she refused to be remembered as a model and male artists’ muse. Lee Miller defied the expectations and rules of the time and travelled to Europe to report from the frontline. There, in part as a reaction to her own well-hidden trauma, she used her Rolleiflex camera to give a voice to the voiceless. What Lee captured on film in Dachau and\nthroughout Europe was shocking and horrific. Her photographs of the war, its victims and its consequences remain among the most significant and historically important of the Second World War. She changed war photography forever, but Lee paid an enormous personal price for what she witnessed and the stories she fought to tell.",

Once a successful businesswoman, she puts her life on hold to become a modern-day Charon, transporting the bodies of fallen soldiers. Tetiana navigates dangerous terrains in her car, and retrieves fallen Ukrainian defenders from morgues in war-torn cities. Each trip, spanning up to 1,300 km, is an arduous experience, filled with constant danger and sleep deprivation. During every mission she captures photographs of the fallen soldiers, aiding grieving families in identifying their loved ones, confronting her own inner wounds and struggling to reconcile the changes the war has wrought upon her. The film demonstrates the indomitable spirit of an ordinary woman turned guardian of the fallen. It showcases her enduring resilience and the profound impact she has on the lives of grieving families — and her own injured soul.\r\n\r\nFollowed by a Q&A with the filmmakers.\r\n",

Horrified and grieving, but forced to deny it, Katherine finds herself fighting for her own survival. Conspiracy reverberates through the palace.

After years of silence, the forced separation, assimilation and abuse many children experienced at these segregated boarding schools was brought to light, sparking a national outcry against a system designed to destroy Indigenous communities.\r\n\r\nSet amidst the groundbreaking investigation, Sugarcane illuminates the heartbreak and beauty of a community breaking cycles of intergenerational trauma and finding the strength to survive.",

Winner of the Best Actor award at Cannes 2023, Koji Yakusho (Babel, 13 Assassins) stars as Hirayama, a contemplative middle-aged man who lives a life of modesty and serenity, spending his days balancing his job as a dutiful caretaker of Tokyo’s numerous public toilets with his passion for music, literature and photography. As we join him on his structured daily routine, a series of unexpected encounters gradually begin to reveal a hidden past that lies behind his otherwise content and harmonious life. \n\nCombining a refreshingly unstereotypical depiction of the Japanese capital with a soundtrack comprised of iconic hits from the 60s and 80s, this is a subtle, shimmering and ultimately life-affirming reflection on finding beauty in the everyday world around us. Japan’s entry for Best International Film at the 2024 Academy Awards.\n",

As a middle-aged woman, she refused to be remembered as a model and male artists’ muse. Lee Miller defied the expectations and rules of the time and travelled to Europe to report from the frontline. There, in part as a reaction to her own well-hidden trauma, she used her Rolleiflex camera to give a voice to the voiceless. What Lee captured on film in Dachau and\nthroughout Europe was shocking and horrific. Her photographs of the war, its victims and its consequences remain among the most significant and historically important of the Second World War. She changed war photography forever, but Lee paid an enormous personal price for what she witnessed and the stories she fought to tell.",

Determined to document the truth of the Nazi regime, and in spite of the odds stacked against female correspondents, Lee captured some of the most important images of World War II, for which she paid an enormous personal price.\nThe film is not a biopic, instead it explores the most significant decade of Lee Miller’s life. As a middle-aged woman, she refused to be remembered as a model and male artists’ muse. Lee Miller defied the expectations and rules of the time and travelled to Europe to report from the frontline. There, in part as a reaction to her own well-hidden trauma, she used her Rolleiflex camera to give a voice to the voiceless. What Lee captured on film in Dachau and\nthroughout Europe was shocking and horrific. Her photographs of the war, its victims and its consequences remain among the most significant and historically important of the Second World War. She changed war photography forever, but Lee paid an enormous personal price for what she witnessed and the stories she fought to tell.",

All it takes is one injection and she is reborn – temporarily – as the gorgeous, twentysomething Sue (Margaret Qualley). \n\nThe only rule? Time needs to be split: exactly one week in one body, then one week in the other. No exceptions. A perfect balance. What could go wrong?\n\nDeliriously entertaining and ruthlessly satirical, Coralie Fargeat’s Cannes sensation turns toxic beauty culture inside out with a be-careful-what-you-wish-for fable for the ages. Explosive, provocative and twisted, THE SUBSTANCE marks the arrival of a thrillingly visionary filmmaker.\n",

This avant-garde film was banned just nine days after its release in the USSR and received recognition in Ukraine only after Dovzhenko’s death.\r\n\r\nThe film depicts a Ukrainian village on the brink of collectivisation. Vasyl, the leader of the activist youth, strives to involve the villagers in the collective farm movement while awaiting a technological marvel: a tractor, symbolising the new era. Dovzhenko transforms the story of class struggle into a universal philosophical parable about life and death.\r\n\r\nThe musical score is composed and performed by the band DakhaBrakha, commissioned by the Dovzhenko Centre.\r\n",

Katherine has done everything she can to push for a new future based on her radical Protestant beliefs. When an increasingly ailing and paranoid King returns, he turns his fury on the radicals, charging Katherine’s childhood friend with treason and burning her at the stake.  Horrified and grieving, but forced to deny it, Katherine finds herself fighting for her own survival. Conspiracy reverberates through the palace. Everyone holds their breath – for the queen to slip up, for Henry to take her head like wives before. With the hope for a future free of tyranny at risk, will Katherine submit to the inevitable for the sake of King and country? ",

Our future World Powers will be those who control not oil, but food, and the grab for land, water and means of production is already under way.\r\n\r\nAs THE GRAB investigates, it all begins to bubble to the surface in real time. Global food prices have hit an all-time high, threatening chaos and violence. Meanwhile, Russia is using food as a weapon against the Ukrainians, and as a geopolitical tool to wield global power.\r\n\r\nDirector Gabriela Cowperthwaite combines hard-hitting journalism from The Center for Investigative Reporting with her compelling character-driven storytelling, taking us around the globe from Arizona to Zambia in this revelatory expose.\r\n",

All it takes is one injection and she is reborn – temporarily – as the gorgeous, twentysomething Sue (Margaret Qualley). \n\nThe only rule? Time needs to be split: exactly one week in one body, then one week in the other. No exceptions. A perfect balance. What could go wrong?\n\nDeliriously entertaining and ruthlessly satirical, Coralie Fargeat’s Cannes sensation turns toxic beauty culture inside out with a be-careful-what-you-wish-for fable for the ages. Explosive, provocative and twisted, THE SUBSTANCE marks the arrival of a thrillingly visionary filmmaker.\n",

As a middle-aged woman, she refused to be remembered as a model and male artists’ muse. Lee Miller defied the expectations and rules of the time and travelled to Europe to report from the frontline. There, in part as a reaction to her own well-hidden trauma, she used her Rolleiflex camera to give a voice to the voiceless. What Lee captured on film in Dachau and\nthroughout Europe was shocking and horrific. Her photographs of the war, its victims and its consequences remain among the most significant and historically important of the Second World War. She changed war photography forever, but Lee paid an enormous personal price for what she witnessed and the stories she fought to tell.",

As a middle-aged woman, she refused to be remembered as a model and male artists’ muse. Lee Miller defied the expectations and rules of the time and travelled to Europe to report from the frontline. There, in part as a reaction to her own well-hidden trauma, she used her Rolleiflex camera to give a voice to the voiceless. What Lee captured on film in Dachau and\nthroughout Europe was shocking and horrific. Her photographs of the war, its victims and its consequences remain among the most significant and historically important of the Second World War. She changed war photography forever, but Lee paid an enormous personal price for what she witnessed and the stories she fought to tell.",

Determined to document the truth of the Nazi regime, and in spite of the odds stacked against female correspondents, Lee captured some of the most important images of World War II, for which she paid an enormous personal price.\nThe film is not a biopic, instead it explores the most significant decade of Lee Miller’s life. As a middle-aged woman, she refused to be remembered as a model and male artists’ muse. Lee Miller defied the expectations and rules of the time and travelled to Europe to report from the frontline. There, in part as a reaction to her own well-hidden trauma, she used her Rolleiflex camera to give a voice to the voiceless. What Lee captured on film in Dachau and\nthroughout Europe was shocking and horrific. Her photographs of the war, its victims and its consequences remain among the most significant and historically important of the Second World War. She changed war photography forever, but Lee paid an enormous personal price for what she witnessed and the stories she fought to tell.",

All it takes is one injection and she is reborn – temporarily – as the gorgeous, twentysomething Sue (Margaret Qualley). \n\nThe only rule? Time needs to be split: exactly one week in one body, then one week in the other. No exceptions. A perfect balance. What could go wrong?\n\nDeliriously entertaining and ruthlessly satirical, Coralie Fargeat’s Cannes sensation turns toxic beauty culture inside out with a be-careful-what-you-wish-for fable for the ages. Explosive, provocative and twisted, THE SUBSTANCE marks the arrival of a thrillingly visionary filmmaker.\n",

His dysfunctional parents yell at him, his spiteful schoolteacher picks on him and luck just never goes his way. Despite his efforts at patience, one day it all becomes too much and Antoine throws in the towel, choosing to take his chances on the Paris streets. At times joyous and at others bitterly hard, his new life brings a newfound freedom – one that Antoine will follow up to its painful, poignant and beautiful conclusion.\n\nFrancois Truffaut's first feature film and arguably the starting point of the Nouvelle Vague, The 400 Blows is a true landmark in French cinema. Raw, honest, and intensely emotional, it captures youth in startlingly vivid detail and holds a mesmerising, unflinching mirror up to life itself.\r\n\r\nFrancois Truffaut's classic of the French New Wave played for over three months at Curzon Mayfair upon its UK release in 1960. His later films The Bride Wore Black, The Last Metro and Finally, Sunday! also played Mayfair on extended runs, the latter, and Truffaut's final movie, was released by Art Eye. ",

After years of silence, the forced separation, assimilation and abuse many children experienced at these segregated boarding schools was brought to light, sparking a national outcry against a system designed to destroy Indigenous communities.\r\n\r\nSet amidst the groundbreaking investigation, Sugarcane illuminates the heartbreak and beauty of a community breaking cycles of intergenerational trauma and finding the strength to survive.",

As we join him on his structured daily routine, a series of unexpected encounters gradually begin to reveal a hidden past that lies behind his otherwise content and harmonious life. \n\nCombining a refreshingly unstereotypical depiction of the Japanese capital with a soundtrack comprised of iconic hits from the 60s and 80s, this is a subtle, shimmering and ultimately life-affirming reflection on finding beauty in the everyday world around us.

As a middle-aged woman, she refused to be remembered as a model and male artists’ muse. Lee Miller defied the expectations and rules of the time and travelled to Europe to report from the frontline. There, in part as a reaction to her own well-hidden trauma, she used her Rolleiflex camera to give a voice to the voiceless. What Lee captured on film in Dachau and\nthroughout Europe was shocking and horrific. Her photographs of the war, its victims and its consequences remain among the most significant and historically important of the Second World War. She changed war photography forever, but Lee paid an enormous personal price for what she witnessed and the stories she fought to tell.",

Meanwhile, Russia is using food as a weapon against the Ukrainians, and as a geopolitical tool to wield global power.\r\n\r\nDirector Gabriela Cowperthwaite combines hard-hitting journalism from The Center for Investigative Reporting with her compelling character-driven storytelling, taking us around the globe from Arizona to Zambia in this revelatory expose.\r\n",
