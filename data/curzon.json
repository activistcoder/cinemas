Interspersed throughout are interviews with prominent journalists, Israeli statesmen, Netanyahu's associates, and longtime friends, whose observations and anecdotes reveal a chilling portrait of a leader who, in his drive to evade justice, has aligned himself with radical right-wing extremists. Netanyahu’s fixation on his entitlement to remain Prime Minister has, in this way, led to political decisions that have endangered Israel’s safety, and destroyed her standing as a democracy in the Middle East.\r\n",

Samantha Morton (MINORITY REPORT) plays a survivor besieged by nightmare visions of the past—a past that happens to be our present, visualised through contemporary footage interconnecting today’s global crises of authoritarianism, unchecked big tech, inequality, and our global climate crisis.\r\n\r\n2073 is an urgent, unshakable vision of a dystopic future that could very well be our own.\r\n",

Seven documentaries use the camera to (de)construct one’s identity with all the chaotic, messy and not-yet-decided parts that come with it, while the medium of film provides enough space to invent the rules of life anew. \r\n\r\nWhether following a neurotic tour guide around ‘one of the most scrambled cities in the world’ or a crew of graffiti writers in a secret Italian forest, the selection is permeated by the impatience and ephemerality the process of growing up entails.\r\n\r\nRuskin is Interested, dir.

Democracy was hard-baked into young Arum's world view, but, confronted with the Sewol ferry disaster at the age of 18, she begins question the system crafted by her parents' generation.\r\n\r\nWith the lightest of touches, Arum's playful, personal film explores recent Korean history and the complexities of family dynamics.

Surveillance drones fill the burnt orange skies and militarised police roam the wrecked streets, while humans hide away underground, struggling to remember a free and hopeful existence. In this ingenious mixture of visionary science fiction and nonfiction, Oscar-winning director, Asif Kapadia (SENNA, AMY) transports us to a future foreshadowed by the terrifying realities of our present. Samantha Morton (MINORITY REPORT) plays a survivor besieged by nightmare visions of the past—a past that happens to be our present, visualised through contemporary footage interconnecting today’s global crises of authoritarianism, unchecked big tech, inequality, and our global climate crisis.\r\n\r\n2073 is an urgent, unshakable vision of a dystopic future that could very well be our own.\r\n",

Surveillance drones fill the burnt orange skies and militarised police roam the wrecked streets, while humans hide away underground, struggling to remember a free and hopeful existence. In this ingenious mixture of visionary science fiction and nonfiction, Oscar-winning director, Asif Kapadia (SENNA, AMY) transports us to a future foreshadowed by the terrifying realities of our present. Samantha Morton (MINORITY REPORT) plays a survivor besieged by nightmare visions of the past—a past that happens to be our present, visualised through contemporary footage interconnecting today’s global crises of authoritarianism, unchecked big tech, inequality, and our global climate crisis.\r\n\r\n2073 is an urgent, unshakable vision of a dystopic future that could very well be our own.\r\n",

Director Alessandra Celesia unearths the emotional wounds left on the families remaining on the estate – the legacy of political violence. As protagonist Joe grapples with personal tragedy, including the murder of his teenage uncle, his story intertwines with those of his neighbours: Angie, haunted by a violent past, and Jolene, who finds solace in music. Through moving reconstructions, testimonies and archival footage, Celesia’s profound and deeply human film reveals the ways unresolved trauma endures and changes across generations.",
