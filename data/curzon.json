THE HUNGER GAMES: THE BALLAD OF SONGBIRDS & SNAKES follows a young Coriolanus (Tom Blyth) who is the last hope for his failing lineage, the once-proud Snow family that has fallen from grace in a post-war Capitol. With his livelihood threatened, Snow is reluctantly assigned to mentor Lucy Gray Baird (Rachel Zegler), a tribute from the impoverished District 12. But after Lucy Grayâs charm captivates the audience of Panem, Snow sees an opportunity to shift their fates. With everything he has worked for hanging in the balance, Snow unites with Lucy Gray to turn the odds in their favor. Battling his instincts for both good and evil, Snow sets out on a race against time to survive and reveal if he will ultimately become a songbird or a snake.",

Also starring Robert De Niro and Jesse Plemons, âKillers of the Flower Moonâ is directed by Academy Award winner Martin Scorsese from a screenplay by Eric Roth and Martin Scorsese, based on David Grannâs best-selling book.",

And beyond the confines of the minibus, we witness the expanse of rural Ukraine â a vast landscape of natural beauty littered with the carnage of war, and the desolation and destruction of once populated communities.",

With his livelihood threatened, Snow is reluctantly assigned to mentor Lucy Gray Baird (Rachel Zegler), a tribute from the impoverished District 12. But after Lucy Grayâs charm captivates the audience of Panem, Snow sees an opportunity to shift their fates. With everything he has worked for hanging in the balance, Snow unites with Lucy Gray to turn the odds in their favor. Battling his instincts for both good and evil, Snow sets out on a race against time to survive and reveal if he will ultimately become a songbird or a snake.",

      "synopsis": "While navigating daily discrimination, a filmmaker who inhabits and loves her unusual body searches the world for another person like her, and explores what it takes to love oneself fiercely despite the pervasiveness of ableism.\r\n\r\nGroundbreaking documentary, Is There Anybody Out There? follows filmmaker Ella Glendiningâs global search for someone with a body that looks like hers, and explores what it takes to love yourself fiercely as a disabled person in an ableist world. \r\n\r\nâMy body is extremely unusual, and Iâve never seen another like my own. Is There Anybody Out There? is a personal documentary following my search to track down other individuals with the same rare disability as me. The film also explores the experience of being a disabled pregnant woman as well as the emotional process of becoming a mother, when I unexpectedly find out I am pregnant. Perhaps, more than anything however, this story is about ableism â about living in a world where youâre seen as less than human â and what it takes to love yourself fiercely despite this.â \r\n\r\nReclaim The Frame is an organisation dedicated to bringing ever greater audiences to films by people from marginalised genders to offer a wider perspective of the world. This project seeks to empower audiences to make a positive intervention in the distribution and exhibition space, to prove that these filmmakers are commercially viable and in demand.\r\n\r\nOur Reclaim The Frame events create a space to discuss what's under the surface of each story.

THE HUNGER GAMES: THE BALLAD OF SONGBIRDS & SNAKES follows a young Coriolanus (Tom Blyth) who is the last hope for his failing lineage, the once-proud Snow family that has fallen from grace in a post-war Capitol. With his livelihood threatened, Snow is reluctantly assigned to mentor Lucy Gray Baird (Rachel Zegler), a tribute from the impoverished District 12. But after Lucy Grayâs charm captivates the audience of Panem, Snow sees an opportunity to shift their fates. With everything he has worked for hanging in the balance, Snow unites with Lucy Gray to turn the odds in their favor. Battling his instincts for both good and evil, Snow sets out on a race against time to survive and reveal if he will ultimately become a songbird or a snake.",

      "synopsis": "A moving portrait of social documentary photographer and trailblazer Tish Murtha, who dedicated her life to documenting the lives of working-class communities in North East England.\r\nÂ \r\nPaul Sngâs powerful film celebrates the work of Murtha and her commitment to fighting for the communities like the one she grew up in. Born in the northern coastal town of South Shields, she was driven by a fierce conviction to record the impact of Thatcher era de-industrialisation upon local communities. Her striking black and white photos convey a tenderness and intimacy that set her apart from her peers and her work would become a powerful record of a world decimated by a new and ruthless form of capitalism. .\r\nÂ \r\nThe film follows Tishâs daughter Ella as she revisits key moments from her motherâs life and work. She is accompanied by people who remained close to Tish throughout her life, and who are committed to ensuring her remarkable legacy is recognised.\r\n",

In frigid 1960s Boston, Eileen (Thomasin McKenzie) shuffles between her fatherâs dingy, emotionally haunted home and the prison where she works alongside colleagues who have ostracized her. When an intoxicating woman (Anne Hathaway) joins the prison staff, Eileen is taken. Just when the possibility of a salvational friendship (or maybe more) takes hold and forms a singular glimmer in Eileenâs darkness, her newfound confidant entangles her in a shocking crime that alters all.",

With his livelihood threatened, Snow is reluctantly assigned to mentor Lucy Gray Baird (Rachel Zegler), a tribute from the impoverished District 12. But after Lucy Grayâs charm captivates the audience of Panem, Snow sees an opportunity to shift their fates. With everything he has worked for hanging in the balance, Snow unites with Lucy Gray to turn the odds in their favor. Battling his instincts for both good and evil, Snow sets out on a race against time to survive and reveal if he will ultimately become a songbird or a snake.",

But when a local bakery employs Sri Lankans to make up for a lack of interest from local workers, prejudices and petty recriminations surface, which gradually tear the community apart. \r\n \r\nCristian Mungiuâs provocative drama blows apart notions of multiculturalism with a scathing indictment of how fractured modern life has become. Just as he previously explored corrosion within the family (4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days), the church (Beyond the Hills) and seats of power (Graduation), with R.M.N. Mungiu presents a large-scale, state-of-the-nation portrait that both ranks alongside his earlier films and is also the summation of them. It is a riveting, chilling and brilliant work by one of contemporary cinemaâs mast filmmakers.\r\n\r\nWriter-director Cristian Mungiu will introduce the film and take part in a Q&A following the screening.\r\n",

From lost phone numbers to mistaken addresses, alcoholism and a charming stray dog, the pairâs path to happiness is as bittersweet as it is ultimately delightful. \n\nShot through with KaurismÃ¤kiâs typically playful, idiosyncratic style and deadpan sense of humor, this tender romantic tragicomedy is both a loving tribute to the filmmakerâs beloved contemporaries and a timely reminder of the potency of movie-going from one of cinemaâs living legends.

THE HUNGER GAMES: THE BALLAD OF SONGBIRDS & SNAKES follows a young Coriolanus (Tom Blyth) who is the last hope for his failing lineage, the once-proud Snow family that has fallen from grace in a post-war Capitol. With his livelihood threatened, Snow is reluctantly assigned to mentor Lucy Gray Baird (Rachel Zegler), a tribute from the impoverished District 12. But after Lucy Grayâs charm captivates the audience of Panem, Snow sees an opportunity to shift their fates. With everything he has worked for hanging in the balance, Snow unites with Lucy Gray to turn the odds in their favor. Battling his instincts for both good and evil, Snow sets out on a race against time to survive and reveal if he will ultimately become a songbird or a snake.",

      "synopsis": "Otillaâs friend Gabita is pregnant. She doesnât want the baby. However, abortion is illegal in CeauÈescuâs Romania. So, Otilla arranges for a backstreet procedure. But by crossing that legal boundary the young women risk arrest, and place themselves at the mercy of black marketeers and individuals who operate in a moral vacuum.\r\n\r\nWinner of the Palme dâOr at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival, Cristian Mungiuâs film could have been unbearably bleak. It is uncompromising, but it is also a blackly comic portrait of a society under the control of a corrupt dictatorship. Anamaria Marincaâs stunning central performance as Otilla gives the film its heart, while Vlad Ivanov is chilling in his portrayal of the abortionist. Mungiuâs rich and rewarding drama, a masterpiece in every way, remains one of the key films of what critics labelled the Romanian New Wave.\r\n\r\nThe film is screening from a 35mm print and will be followed by an interview with actor Vlad Ivanov.\r\n",

From lost phone numbers to mistaken addresses, alcoholism and a charming stray dog, the pairâs path to happiness is as bittersweet as it is ultimately delightful. \n\nShot through with KaurismÃ¤kiâs typically playful, idiosyncratic style and deadpan sense of humor, this tender romantic tragicomedy is both a loving tribute to the filmmakerâs beloved contemporaries and a timely reminder of the potency of movie-going from one of cinemaâs living legends.

THE HUNGER GAMES: THE BALLAD OF SONGBIRDS & SNAKES follows a young Coriolanus (Tom Blyth) who is the last hope for his failing lineage, the once-proud Snow family that has fallen from grace in a post-war Capitol. With his livelihood threatened, Snow is reluctantly assigned to mentor Lucy Gray Baird (Rachel Zegler), a tribute from the impoverished District 12. But after Lucy Grayâs charm captivates the audience of Panem, Snow sees an opportunity to shift their fates. With everything he has worked for hanging in the balance, Snow unites with Lucy Gray to turn the odds in their favor. Battling his instincts for both good and evil, Snow sets out on a race against time to survive and reveal if he will ultimately become a songbird or a snake.",

From lost phone numbers to mistaken addresses, alcoholism and a charming stray dog, the pairâs path to happiness is as bittersweet as it is ultimately delightful. \n\nShot through with KaurismÃ¤kiâs typically playful, idiosyncratic style and deadpan sense of humor, this tender romantic tragicomedy is both a loving tribute to the filmmakerâs beloved contemporaries and a timely reminder of the potency of movie-going from one of cinemaâs living legends.

In frigid 1960s Boston, Eileen (Thomasin McKenzie) shuffles between her fatherâs dingy, emotionally haunted home and the prison where she works alongside colleagues who have ostracized her.

With his livelihood threatened, Snow is reluctantly assigned to mentor Lucy Gray Baird (Rachel Zegler), a tribute from the impoverished District 12. But after Lucy Grayâs charm captivates the audience of Panem, Snow sees an opportunity to shift their fates. With everything he has worked for hanging in the balance, Snow unites with Lucy Gray to turn the odds in their favor. Battling his instincts for both good and evil, Snow sets out on a race against time to survive and reveal if he will ultimately become a songbird or a snake.",

As strange sonic booms shatter the peace of the countryside, and animals start to migrate in strange ways, the physical and mental health of the families begins to disintegrate. The renters are upscale and White; the owners are upscale and Black. The issues of race and clash become distractions to the more alarming things are happening all around them.",

From lost phone numbers to mistaken addresses, alcoholism and a charming stray dog, the pairâs path to happiness is as bittersweet as it is ultimately delightful. \n\nShot through with KaurismÃ¤kiâs typically playful, idiosyncratic style and deadpan sense of humor, this tender romantic tragicomedy is both a loving tribute to the filmmakerâs beloved contemporaries and a timely reminder of the potency of movie-going from one of cinemaâs living legends.

By doing that, she wants to change peopleâs perception of beauty and queerness and bring attention to the harassment of the LGBTQ+ community. The performances - often dark, strange, evocative, and queer at their core - are a manifestation of Genaâs subconscious. But they come at a price.",

Her raw vulnerability is exposed, as she searches for acceptance in a place that adamantly rejects her identity.\r\n\r\nFilmed over four years, and spanning the outbreak of war, Queendom is much more than just an artist's portrait.

THE HUNGER GAMES: THE BALLAD OF SONGBIRDS & SNAKES follows a young Coriolanus (Tom Blyth) who is the last hope for his failing lineage, the once-proud Snow family that has fallen from grace in a post-war Capitol. With his livelihood threatened, Snow is reluctantly assigned to mentor Lucy Gray Baird (Rachel Zegler), a tribute from the impoverished District 12. But after Lucy Grayâs charm captivates the audience of Panem, Snow sees an opportunity to shift their fates. With everything he has worked for hanging in the balance, Snow unites with Lucy Gray to turn the odds in their favor. Battling his instincts for both good and evil, Snow sets out on a race against time to survive and reveal if he will ultimately become a songbird or a snake.",

From lost phone numbers to mistaken addresses, alcoholism and a charming stray dog, the pairâs path to happiness is as bittersweet as it is ultimately delightful. \n\nShot through with KaurismÃ¤kiâs typically playful, idiosyncratic style and deadpan sense of humor, this tender romantic tragicomedy is both a loving tribute to the filmmakerâs beloved contemporaries and a timely reminder of the potency of movie-going from one of cinemaâs living legends.

By doing that, she wants to change peopleâs perception of beauty and queerness and bring attention to the harassment of the LGBTQ+ community. The performances - often dark, strange, evocative, and queer at their core - are a manifestation of Genaâs subconscious. But they come at a price.",

She stages radical performances that become a new form of art and activism, but her defiance comes at a price.\r\n\r\nRaised in a small town by her grandparents, Gena leaves to study in Moscow. Through evocative performances, she protests against the government and sheds light on the persecution endured by the LGBTQ+ community. This defiant young activist faces a multitude of challenges, notably the looming threat of compulsory military conscription. Her raw vulnerability is exposed, as she searches for acceptance in a place that adamantly rejects her identity.\r\n\r\nFilmed over four years, and spanning the outbreak of war, Queendom is much more than just an artist's portrait. This visually striking yet thought-provoking film encapsulates a crucial turning point in Russia's transition from its older to younger generation.",
