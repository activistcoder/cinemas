Born in the northern coastal town of South Shields, she was driven by a fierce conviction to record the impact of Thatcher era de-industrialisation upon local communities. Her striking black and white photos convey a tenderness and intimacy that set her apart from her peers and her work would become a powerful record of a world decimated by a new and ruthless form of capitalism. .\r\n \r\nThe film follows Tish’s daughter Ella as she revisits key moments from her mother’s life and work. She is accompanied by people who remained close to Tish throughout her life, and who are committed to ensuring her remarkable legacy is recognised.\r\n",

With his livelihood threatened, Snow is reluctantly assigned to mentor Lucy Gray Baird (Rachel Zegler), a tribute from the impoverished District 12. But after Lucy Gray’s charm captivates the audience of Panem, Snow sees an opportunity to shift their fates. With everything he has worked for hanging in the balance, Snow unites with Lucy Gray to turn the odds in their favor. Battling his instincts for both good and evil, Snow sets out on a race against time to survive and reveal if he will ultimately become a songbird or a snake.",

From lost phone numbers to mistaken addresses, alcoholism and a charming stray dog, the pair’s path to happiness is as bittersweet as it is ultimately delightful. \n\nShot through with Kaurismäki’s typically playful, idiosyncratic style and deadpan sense of humor, this tender romantic tragicomedy is both a loving tribute to the filmmaker’s beloved contemporaries and a timely reminder of the potency of movie-going from one of cinema’s living legends.

THE HUNGER GAMES: THE BALLAD OF SONGBIRDS & SNAKES follows a young Coriolanus (Tom Blyth) who is the last hope for his failing lineage, the once-proud Snow family that has fallen from grace in a post-war Capitol. With his livelihood threatened, Snow is reluctantly assigned to mentor Lucy Gray Baird (Rachel Zegler), a tribute from the impoverished District 12. But after Lucy Gray’s charm captivates the audience of Panem, Snow sees an opportunity to shift their fates. With everything he has worked for hanging in the balance, Snow unites with Lucy Gray to turn the odds in their favor. Battling his instincts for both good and evil, Snow sets out on a race against time to survive and reveal if he will ultimately become a songbird or a snake.",

      "synopsis": "Otilla’s friend Gabita is pregnant. She doesn’t want the baby. However, abortion is illegal in Ceaușescu’s Romania. So, Otilla arranges for a backstreet procedure. But by crossing that legal boundary the young women risk arrest, and place themselves at the mercy of black marketeers and individuals who operate in a moral vacuum.\r\n\r\nWinner of the Palme d’Or at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival, Cristian Mungiu’s film could have been unbearably bleak. It is uncompromising, but it is also a blackly comic portrait of a society under the control of a corrupt dictatorship. Anamaria Marinca’s stunning central performance as Otilla gives the film its heart, while Vlad Ivanov is chilling in his portrayal of the abortionist. Mungiu’s rich and rewarding drama, a masterpiece in every way, remains one of the key films of what critics labelled the Romanian New Wave.\r\n\r\nThe film is screening from a 35mm print and will be followed by an interview with actor Vlad Ivanov.\r\n",

From lost phone numbers to mistaken addresses, alcoholism and a charming stray dog, the pair’s path to happiness is as bittersweet as it is ultimately delightful. \n\nShot through with Kaurismäki’s typically playful, idiosyncratic style and deadpan sense of humor, this tender romantic tragicomedy is both a loving tribute to the filmmaker’s beloved contemporaries and a timely reminder of the potency of movie-going from one of cinema’s living legends.

No distractions; just you and the music. \r\n\r\n\"I love the Pitchblack Playback events because one of the frustrations about mixing in spatial audio is the knowledge that most people will never get to hear it the way I did in my studio —after all, how many people have a full spatial audio setup in their home?   Listening to a binaural version on headphones can be good, but it’s nowhere near the magical experience of hearing a fully discrete spatial audio mix coming from all around you in a beautiful sounding room. There’s also something wonderful about the experience of hearing an album with other like-minded people, in the dark and without any distractions. It’s the way I remember experiencing music when I was a teenager, turning out the lights and just allowing myself to be carried away by the music.\" - Steven Wilson\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Born in the northern coastal town of South Shields, she was driven by a fierce conviction to record the impact of Thatcher era de-industrialisation upon local communities. Her striking black and white photos convey a tenderness and intimacy that set her apart from her peers and her work would become a powerful record of a world decimated by a new and ruthless form of capitalism. .\r\n \r\nThe film follows Tish’s daughter Ella as she revisits key moments from her mother’s life and work. She is accompanied by people who remained close to Tish throughout her life, and who are committed to ensuring her remarkable legacy is recognised.\r\n",

Aurora Mardiganian played herself in the blockbuster film of her life, which brought the plight of the Armenians to the wider world. All copies of Auction of Souls were believed to be lost, until 1994 when 18 minutes of film were rediscovered, just a few months after Aurora's death, aged 93.\r\n\r\nAurora's Sunrise revives Aurora's story through a blend of evocative animation, her own recollections and the 18 minutes of surviving footage from her lost silent epic. It vividly recalls an often-ignored 20th Century genocide, telling the tale of how one girl escaped, and then relived her life’s greatest pain to save her people.",

THE HUNGER GAMES: THE BALLAD OF SONGBIRDS & SNAKES follows a young Coriolanus (Tom Blyth) who is the last hope for his failing lineage, the once-proud Snow family that has fallen from grace in a post-war Capitol. With his livelihood threatened, Snow is reluctantly assigned to mentor Lucy Gray Baird (Rachel Zegler), a tribute from the impoverished District 12. But after Lucy Gray’s charm captivates the audience of Panem, Snow sees an opportunity to shift their fates. With everything he has worked for hanging in the balance, Snow unites with Lucy Gray to turn the odds in their favor. Battling his instincts for both good and evil, Snow sets out on a race against time to survive and reveal if he will ultimately become a songbird or a snake.",

From lost phone numbers to mistaken addresses, alcoholism and a charming stray dog, the pair’s path to happiness is as bittersweet as it is ultimately delightful. \n\nShot through with Kaurismäki’s typically playful, idiosyncratic style and deadpan sense of humor, this tender romantic tragicomedy is both a loving tribute to the filmmaker’s beloved contemporaries and a timely reminder of the potency of movie-going from one of cinema’s living legends.

      "synopsis": "Director Agniia Galdanova points her camera on Putin's Russia, unveiling the harsh repercussions faced by those who stray from societal norms.\r\n\r\n21-year-old Gena is a queer performance artist who transforms the streets of Russia into her runway, confronting the public with her other-wordly, extravagant costumes. She stages radical performances that become a new form of art and activism, but her defiance comes at a price.\r\n\r\nRaised in a small town by her grandparents, Gena leaves to study in Moscow. Through evocative performances, she protests against the government and sheds light on the persecution endured by the LGBTQ+ community. This defiant young activist faces a multitude of challenges, notably the looming threat of compulsory military conscription. Her raw vulnerability is exposed, as she searches for acceptance in a place that adamantly rejects her identity.\r\n\r\nFilmed over four years, and spanning the outbreak of war, Queendom is much more than just an artist's portrait. This visually striking yet thought-provoking film encapsulates a crucial turning point in Russia's transition from its older to younger generation.",

From lost phone numbers to mistaken addresses, alcoholism and a charming stray dog, the pair’s path to happiness is as bittersweet as it is ultimately delightful. \n\nShot through with Kaurismäki’s typically playful, idiosyncratic style and deadpan sense of humor, this tender romantic tragicomedy is both a loving tribute to the filmmaker’s beloved contemporaries and a timely reminder of the potency of movie-going from one of cinema’s living legends.

All copies of Auction of Souls were believed to be lost, until 1994 when 18 minutes of film were rediscovered, just a few months after Aurora's death, aged 93.\r\n\r\nAurora's Sunrise revives Aurora's story through a blend of evocative animation, her own recollections and the 18 minutes of surviving footage from her lost silent epic. It vividly recalls an often-ignored 20th Century genocide, telling the tale of how one girl escaped, and then relived her life’s greatest pain to save her people.",

Born in the northern coastal town of South Shields, she was driven by a fierce conviction to record the impact of Thatcher era de-industrialisation upon local communities. Her striking black and white photos convey a tenderness and intimacy that set her apart from her peers and her work would become a powerful record of a world decimated by a new and ruthless form of capitalism. .\r\n \r\nThe film follows Tish’s daughter Ella as she revisits key moments from her mother’s life and work. She is accompanied by people who remained close to Tish throughout her life, and who are committed to ensuring her remarkable legacy is recognised.\r\n",

She stages radical performances that become a new form of art and activism, but her defiance comes at a price.\r\n\r\nRaised in a small town by her grandparents, Gena leaves to study in Moscow. Through evocative performances, she protests against the government and sheds light on the persecution endured by the LGBTQ+ community. This defiant young activist faces a multitude of challenges, notably the looming threat of compulsory military conscription. Her raw vulnerability is exposed, as she searches for acceptance in a place that adamantly rejects her identity.\r\n\r\nFilmed over four years, and spanning the outbreak of war, Queendom is much more than just an artist's portrait. This visually striking yet thought-provoking film encapsulates a crucial turning point in Russia's transition from its older to younger generation.",

With his livelihood threatened, Snow is reluctantly assigned to mentor Lucy Gray Baird (Rachel Zegler), a tribute from the impoverished District 12. But after Lucy Gray’s charm captivates the audience of Panem, Snow sees an opportunity to shift their fates.

From lost phone numbers to mistaken addresses, alcoholism and a charming stray dog, the pair’s path to happiness is as bittersweet as it is ultimately delightful. \n\nShot through with Kaurismäki’s typically playful, idiosyncratic style and deadpan sense of humor, this tender romantic tragicomedy is both a loving tribute to the filmmaker’s beloved contemporaries and a timely reminder of the potency of movie-going from one of cinema’s living legends.

Born and raised on the harsh streets of Magadan, a frigid outpost of the Soviet gulag, Gena is only 21. She stages radical performances in public that become a new form of art and activism. By doing that, she wants to change people’s perception of beauty and queerness and bring attention to the harassment of the LGBTQ+ community. The performances - often dark, strange, evocative, and queer at their core - are a manifestation of Gena’s subconscious. But they come at a price.",

      "synopsis": "Take a celebrated musical genius, some sibling rivalry, an unknown manuscript, BAFTA-winning filmmaker Sheila Hayman, and one sensational revelation and what have you got? Fanny: The Other Mendelssohn – revelatory new feature documentary starring global Decca star, Isata Kanneh-Mason.\nFelix Mendelssohn’s Wedding March may be the best-known classical composition of all time. But Felix was not the only genius in the family. His sister, Fanny was also a brilliant composer. But Fanny was equal to any of her contemporaries, male or female; technically brilliant and boldly ground-breaking. Tragically, the resulting joy and recognition were short-lived. Less than a year later, Fanny died, and shortly afterwards Felix too. But today Fanny's music is beginning to get the recognition it deserves. \nOver a century later, in 1971, the famous pianist Eric Heidsieck was contacted by a record company and asked to produce the first recording of Mendelssohn’s Easter Sonata. It was presumed to be the work of Felix. But in an amazing plot twist, captured as it happened in this extraordinary film, it is once and for all proven definitively to be Fanny’s own piano masterpiece, written when she was only 22. Fanny’s music is brought to life by the gifted virtuoso pianist, Isata Kanneh-Mason, recipient of the 2021 Leonard Bernstein Award and 2021 best classical artist at the Global Awards. And as she discovers the Easter Sonata, the parallels between her life and Fanny’s – including the challenge of being a pioneer with few role models in classical music – become clear.\nDirected by the unheralded composer’s great great great granddaughter, it is moving as it is joyous. This is the story of a very modern woman – who just happened to live 200 years ago.",

From lost phone numbers to mistaken addresses, alcoholism and a charming stray dog, the pair’s path to happiness is as bittersweet as it is ultimately delightful. \n\nShot through with Kaurismäki’s typically playful, idiosyncratic style and deadpan sense of humor, this tender romantic tragicomedy is both a loving tribute to the filmmaker’s beloved contemporaries and a timely reminder of the potency of movie-going from one of cinema’s living legends.

Her striking black and white photos convey a tenderness and intimacy and are a powerful record of a world decimated by a new and ruthless form of capitalism. The film follows Tish’s daughter Ella as she revisits key moments from her mother’s life and work. She is accompanied by people who remained close to Tish throughout her life, and who are committed to ensuring her remarkable legacy is recognised.",

For over two years, Wenders traced Kiefer’s path from his native Germany to his current home in France, connecting the stages of his life to the essential places of his career that spans more than five decades.",

By doing that, she wants to change people’s perception of beauty and queerness and bring attention to the harassment of the LGBTQ+ community. The performances - often dark, strange, evocative, and queer at their core - are a manifestation of Gena’s subconscious. But they come at a price.",

Though he embraces this exciting new exploration, the novelty of being with a woman starts to fade when Martin begins an affair of his own, forcing Tomas to confront life decisions he may be unprepared – or unwilling – to deal with. \n\nPerceptive, intimate and unashamedly sexy, PASSAGES sees Sachs put a uniquely European spin on his usually tender style, telling a messy, modern love story that explores the complexities, contradictions and cruelties of sex and desire.",

With his livelihood threatened, Snow is reluctantly assigned to mentor Lucy Gray Baird (Rachel Zegler), a tribute from the impoverished District 12. But after Lucy Gray’s charm captivates the audience of Panem, Snow sees an opportunity to shift their fates. With everything he has worked for hanging in the balance, Snow unites with Lucy Gray to turn the odds in their favor. Battling his instincts for both good and evil, Snow sets out on a race against time to survive and reveal if he will ultimately become a songbird or a snake.",

From lost phone numbers to mistaken addresses, alcoholism and a charming stray dog, the pair’s path to happiness is as bittersweet as it is ultimately delightful. \n\nShot through with Kaurismäki’s typically playful, idiosyncratic style and deadpan sense of humor, this tender romantic tragicomedy is both a loving tribute to the filmmaker’s beloved contemporaries and a timely reminder of the potency of movie-going from one of cinema’s living legends.

When her estranged father turns up out of blue, she’s forced to confront what’s really going on.",
