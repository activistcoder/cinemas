Winner of the Best Actor award at Cannes 2023, Koji Yakusho (Babel, 13 Assassins) stars as Hirayama, a contemplative middle-aged man who lives a life of modesty and serenity, spending his days balancing his job as a dutiful caretaker of Tokyo’s numerous public toilets with his passion for music, literature and photography. As we join him on his structured daily routine, a series of unexpected encounters gradually begin to reveal a hidden past that lies behind his otherwise content and harmonious life. \n\nCombining a refreshingly unstereotypical depiction of the Japanese capital with a soundtrack comprised of iconic hits from the 60s and 80s, this is a subtle, shimmering and ultimately life-affirming reflection on finding beauty in the everyday world around us. Japan’s entry for Best International Film at the 2024 Academy Awards.\n",

Unfortunately, they drew an away match and suffered a crushing 10-0 defeat. But now, Kari is determined to bring football home to the village, entering the FA Cup once again.\r\n\r\nDirectors Smari Gunn and Logi Sigursveinsson follow along as he pulls together his ragtag local team - a fisherman and his son, a pessimistic church warden and a mother of three - and they train for the match of their lives.\r\n\r\nWinner of multiple festival audience awards, The Home Game is an uplifting celebration of team and community spirit, with a finale that will have even staunchest non-football fan cheering from the sidelines.",

Winner of the Best Actor award at Cannes 2023, Koji Yakusho (Babel, 13 Assassins) stars as Hirayama, a contemplative middle-aged man who lives a life of modesty and serenity, spending his days balancing his job as a dutiful caretaker of Tokyo’s numerous public toilets with his passion for music, literature and photography. As we join him on his structured daily routine, a series of unexpected encounters gradually begin to reveal a hidden past that lies behind his otherwise content and harmonious life. \n\nCombining a refreshingly unstereotypical depiction of the Japanese capital with a soundtrack comprised of iconic hits from the 60s and 80s, this is a subtle, shimmering and ultimately life-affirming reflection on finding beauty in the everyday world around us. Japan’s entry for Best International Film at the 2024 Academy Awards.\n",

      "synopsis": "Pitchblack Playback presents a pre-release listening party (in the dark!) of Nick Cave and The Bad Seeds' fabulous new album WILD GOD.\r\n\r\n“I hope the album has the effect on listeners that it’s had on me,” Cave says. “It bursts out of the speaker, and I get swept up with it. It’s a complicated record, but it’s also deeply and joyously infectious. There is never a masterplan when we make a record. The records rather reflect back the emotional state of the writers and musicians who played them. Listening to this, I don’t know, it seems we’re happy.”\r\n\r\nAcross ten tracks, the band dance between convention and experimentation, taking left-turns and detours that heighten the rich imagery and emotion in Cave’s soul-stirring narratives. It is the sound of a group emboldened by reconnection and taking flight. There are moments that touch fondly upon the Bad Seeds’ past but they are fleeting, and serve only to imbue the relentless and restless forward motion of the band.\r\n\r\nProduced by Cave and Warren Ellis, and mixed by David Fridmann, Cave began writing the album on New Year’s Day 2023. With sessions at Miraval in Provence and Soundtree in London, the Bad Seeds added their unique alchemy, with additional performances from Colin Greenwood (bass) and Luis Almau (nylon string guitar, acoustic guitar).\r\n\r\n“Wild God… there’s no f***ing around with this record. When it hits, it hits. It lifts you. It moves you. I love that about it.” -- Nick Cave\r\n\r\n‘Wild God’ will be released on Bad Seed in partnership with Play It Again Sam on streaming, CD, and standard and limited edition vinyl.\r\n\r\nHear the stunning album before anyone else on Curzon's powerful surround sound system at Pitchblack Playback's listening session in the dark—the ultimate way to hear it for the first time. No distractions—just you and the music. Ticket includes Pitchblack Playback eye mask for extra darkness. Please arrive by event start time as latecomers will not be permitted!",

As we join him on his structured daily routine, a series of unexpected encounters gradually begin to reveal a hidden past that lies behind his otherwise content and harmonious life. \n\nCombining a refreshingly unstereotypical depiction of the Japanese capital with a soundtrack comprised of iconic hits from the 60s and 80s, this is a subtle, shimmering and ultimately life-affirming reflection on finding beauty in the everyday world around us.

Following a man and his daughter in their daily routine, a bizarre series of disturbing events slowly begin to strip life of its very essence resulting in a terrifying, all-consuming finale.\n\nRaw, compelling and emotionally devastating, Béla Tarr’s final film is a daringly original and searingly vivid work of artistically precise, philosophically rigorous filmmaking that has left audiences the world over gasping for breath. This work is also committed to Tarr's 'remodernist cinema' that seeks to capture the rhythm of life in real time and to raise a sharp awareness of the moment.",

      "synopsis": "13-year-old Antoine (Jean-Pierre Léaud) can't seem to do anything right. His dysfunctional parents yell at him, his spiteful schoolteacher picks on him and luck just never goes his way. Despite his efforts at patience, one day it all becomes too much and Antoine throws in the towel, choosing to take his chances on the Paris streets. At times joyous and at others bitterly hard, his new life brings a newfound freedom – one that Antoine will follow up to its painful, poignant and beautiful conclusion.\n\nFrancois Truffaut's first feature film and arguably the starting point of the Nouvelle Vague, The 400 Blows is a true landmark in French cinema. Raw, honest, and intensely emotional, it captures youth in startlingly vivid detail and holds a mesmerising, unflinching mirror up to life itself.\r\n\r\nFrancois Truffaut's classic of the French New Wave played for over three months at Curzon Mayfair upon its UK release in 1960. His later films The Bride Wore Black, The Last Metro and Finally, Sunday! also played Mayfair on extended runs, the latter, and Truffaut's final movie, was released by Art Eye. ",

In this tense role play, they must respond to another Jan 6 insurrection, but this time with members of the US military defecting to support the losing Presidential candidate.\r\n\r\nPlaying out like a real-life political thriller, this expertly crafted hybrid doc is underpinned by fascinating analysis of the ever-gathering, disillusioned US far right, and the growing number of military personal joining their ranks. The scenario here is fictional, but the possibility feels urgently real.",
