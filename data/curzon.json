But the titular wolf is never far from the door; the climate is changing, which forces the family into an urban centre and a new way of life.\r\n\r\nA breathtaking and heartbreaking blend of documentary and fiction, this film is a timely reminder of the sometimes tenuous foundations of the places we call home, and of the imminence of climate emergency.",

A straight line through the centre of the earth, as the two places are antipodes: they are diametrically opposite one another on the Earth's surface.\r\n\r\nIn this audacious, contemplative, stunningly beautiful film, award-winning director Victor Kossakovsky travels to four such antipodal pairs, capturing images that turn our view of the world upside down. A peaceful sunset in Argentina is contrasted with the bustling streets in rainy Shanghai; people who live in a wasteland are connected to people dwelling next to a volcano. The antipodes seem mythically linked, somehow united by their oppositeness.\r\n\r\n¡VIVAN LAS ANTIPODAS! - the first in a trilogy of films that continues with AQUARELA and ARCHITECTON - is a feast for the senses, a fascinating kaleidoscope of our planet.",

Her younger, flightier and rebellious roommate, Anu, tries in vain to find a spot in the city to be intimate with her secret boyfriend.

Interspersed throughout are interviews with prominent journalists, Israeli statesmen, Netanyahu's associates, and longtime friends, whose observations and anecdotes reveal a chilling portrait of a leader who, in his drive to evade justice, has aligned himself with radical right-wing extremists. Netanyahu’s fixation on his entitlement to remain Prime Minister has, in this way, led to political decisions that have endangered Israel’s safety, and destroyed her standing as a democracy in the Middle East.\r\n",

Interspersed throughout are interviews with prominent journalists, Israeli statesmen, Netanyahu's associates, and longtime friends, whose observations and anecdotes reveal a chilling portrait of a leader who, in his drive to evade justice, has aligned himself with radical right-wing extremists. Netanyahu’s fixation on his entitlement to remain Prime Minister has, in this way, led to political decisions that have endangered Israel’s safety, and destroyed her standing as a democracy in the Middle East.\r\n",

      "synopsis": "All We Imagine as Light is a beautiful, sweeping, emotional film that explores the complexities of female friendship and captures the frantic pace, the vibrant colours and the heady atmosphere of modern Mumbai.\n\nIn the city, thoughtful Nurse Prabha’s routine is upset when she receives an unexpected gift from her estranged husband. Her younger, flightier and rebellious roommate, Anu, tries in vain to find a spot in the city to be intimate with her secret boyfriend. Their colleague Parvaty fights to stay in her home without any requisite paperwork left by her late husband. A trip to a beach town allows them each to find a space for their desires to manifest. \n\nPayal Kapadia’s hugely acclaimed fiction debut was the first Indian film to be selected in Official Competition at Cannes in three decades, where it was awarded the Grand Prix.\n",

Britpop and Cool Brittania may have dominated the media mainstream, but this rich seam of underground filmmaking and basement screenings offered a snapshot of real life from across London.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis special opening screening of LSFF brings together rarely-seen early films from filmmakers including Peter Strickland, Carol Morley, Andrea Luka Zimmerman and Alnoor Dewshi. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe filmmakers will join us after the screening for an extended Q&A.\r\n\r\n\r\nLatifah and Himli's Nomadic Uncle (Alnoor Dewshi, 1992, 17 mins)\r\nI'm Not Here (Carol Morley, 1994, 15 min)\r\nThe Hackney Downs (Jamie Thraves, 1995, 13 mins)\r\nThe Insect House (Seonaid MacKay, 3 mins, 1995)\r\nHorseplay (Alison Murray, 5 mins, 1995)\r\nBubblegum (Peter Strickland, 15 mins, 1996)\r\nRaj or Radge?

Surveillance drones fill the burnt orange skies and militarised police roam the wrecked streets, while humans hide away underground, struggling to remember a free and hopeful existence. In this ingenious mixture of visionary science fiction and nonfiction, Oscar-winning director, Asif Kapadia (SENNA, AMY) transports us to a future foreshadowed by the terrifying realities of our present. Samantha Morton (MINORITY REPORT) plays a survivor besieged by nightmare visions of the past—a past that happens to be our present, visualised through contemporary footage interconnecting today’s global crises of authoritarianism, unchecked big tech, inequality, and our global climate crisis.\r\n\r\n2073 is an urgent, unshakable vision of a dystopic future that could very well be our own.\r\n",
