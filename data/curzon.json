THE HUNGER GAMES: THE BALLAD OF SONGBIRDS & SNAKES follows a young Coriolanus (Tom Blyth) who is the last hope for his failing lineage, the once-proud Snow family that has fallen from grace in a post-war Capitol. With his livelihood threatened, Snow is reluctantly assigned to mentor Lucy Gray Baird (Rachel Zegler), a tribute from the impoverished District 12. But after Lucy Gray’s charm captivates the audience of Panem, Snow sees an opportunity to shift their fates. With everything he has worked for hanging in the balance, Snow unites with Lucy Gray to turn the odds in their favor. Battling his instincts for both good and evil, Snow sets out on a race against time to survive and reveal if he will ultimately become a songbird or a snake.",

For over two years, Wenders traced Kiefer’s path from his native Germany to his current home in France, connecting the stages of his life to the essential places of his career that spans more than five decades.\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: Due to an unexpected 3D glasses supply issue at Mayfair, all our Anselm 3D shows will likely be in 2D. We apologise for any inconvenience, as we work to solve the issue and get back to 3D shows as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nMayfair’s new 3D system requires special electronic 3D glasses that we intend to hand out to customers at each 3D performance. At all other venues, commonly used passive 3D glasses will be available to purchase for £1.50, or you can bring your own pair.\r\n\r\n2D performances are available at Soho, Bloomsbury, Hoxton, Richmond, Camden, Wimbledon and Knutsford.",

Wim Wenders creates a portrait of Anselm Kiefer, one of the most innovative and important painters and sculptors of our time, shot in 3D and 6K-resolution. \n\nThe film presents a total immersion in the artist’s work and practice which explores human existence and the cyclical nature of history, inspired by literature, poetry, philosophy, science, mythology and religion. For over two years, Wenders traced Kiefer’s path from his native Germany to his current home in France, connecting the stages of his life to the essential places of his career that spans more than five decades.\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: Due to an unexpected 3D glasses supply issue at Mayfair, all our Anselm 3D shows will likely be in 2D. We apologise for any inconvenience, as we work to solve the issue and get back to 3D shows as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nMayfair’s new 3D system requires special electronic 3D glasses that we intend to hand out to customers at each 3D performance. At all other venues, commonly used passive 3D glasses will be available to purchase for £1.50, or you can bring your own pair.\r\n\r\n2D performances are available at Soho, Bloomsbury, Hoxton, Richmond, Camden, Wimbledon and Knutsford.",

THE HUNGER GAMES: THE BALLAD OF SONGBIRDS & SNAKES follows a young Coriolanus (Tom Blyth) who is the last hope for his failing lineage, the once-proud Snow family that has fallen from grace in a post-war Capitol. With his livelihood threatened, Snow is reluctantly assigned to mentor Lucy Gray Baird (Rachel Zegler), a tribute from the impoverished District 12. But after Lucy Gray’s charm captivates the audience of Panem, Snow sees an opportunity to shift their fates. With everything he has worked for hanging in the balance, Snow unites with Lucy Gray to turn the odds in their favor. Battling his instincts for both good and evil, Snow sets out on a race against time to survive and reveal if he will ultimately become a songbird or a snake.",

From lost phone numbers to mistaken addresses, alcoholism and a charming stray dog, the pair’s path to happiness is as bittersweet as it is ultimately delightful. \n\nShot through with Kaurismäki’s typically playful, idiosyncratic style and deadpan sense of humor, this tender romantic tragicomedy is both a loving tribute to the filmmaker’s beloved contemporaries and a timely reminder of the potency of movie-going from one of cinema’s living legends.

A young woman in her 20s, Therese Belivet (Rooney Mara), is a clerk working in a Manhattan department store and dreaming of a more fulfilling life when she meets Carol (Cate Blanchett), an alluring woman trapped in a loveless, convenient marriage. As an immediate connection sparks between them, the innocence of their first encounter dims and their connection deepens. While Carol breaks free from the confines of marriage, her husband (Kyle Chandler) begins to question her competence as a mother as her involvement with Therese and close relationship with her best friend Abby (Sarah Paulson) come to light.",

Wim Wenders creates a portrait of Anselm Kiefer, one of the most innovative and important painters and sculptors of our time, shot in 3D and 6K-resolution. \n\nThe film presents a total immersion in the artist’s work and practice which explores human existence and the cyclical nature of history, inspired by literature, poetry, philosophy, science, mythology and religion. For over two years, Wenders traced Kiefer’s path from his native Germany to his current home in France, connecting the stages of his life to the essential places of his career that spans more than five decades.\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: Due to an unexpected 3D glasses supply issue at Mayfair, all our Anselm 3D shows will likely be in 2D. We apologise for any inconvenience, as we work to solve the issue and get back to 3D shows as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nMayfair’s new 3D system requires special electronic 3D glasses that we intend to hand out to customers at each 3D performance. At all other venues, commonly used passive 3D glasses will be available to purchase for £1.50, or you can bring your own pair.\r\n\r\n2D performances are available at Soho, Bloomsbury, Hoxton, Richmond, Camden, Wimbledon and Knutsford.",

With his livelihood threatened, Snow is reluctantly assigned to mentor Lucy Gray Baird (Rachel Zegler), a tribute from the impoverished District 12. But after Lucy Gray’s charm captivates the audience of Panem, Snow sees an opportunity to shift their fates. With everything he has worked for hanging in the balance, Snow unites with Lucy Gray to turn the odds in their favor.

From lost phone numbers to mistaken addresses, alcoholism and a charming stray dog, the pair’s path to happiness is as bittersweet as it is ultimately delightful. \n\nShot through with Kaurismäki’s typically playful, idiosyncratic style and deadpan sense of humor, this tender romantic tragicomedy is both a loving tribute to the filmmaker’s beloved contemporaries and a timely reminder of the potency of movie-going from one of cinema’s living legends.

When Jagna finds herself caught between the conflicting desires of the village’s richest farmer, his eldest son, and other leading men of the community, her resistance puts her on a tragic collision course with the community around her.",

Born in the northern coastal town of South Shields, she was driven by a fierce conviction to record the impact of Thatcher era de-industrialisation upon local communities. Her striking black and white photos convey a tenderness and intimacy that set her apart from her peers and her work would become a powerful record of a world decimated by a new and ruthless form of capitalism. .\r\n \r\nThe film follows Tish’s daughter Ella as she revisits key moments from her mother’s life and work. She is accompanied by people who remained close to Tish throughout her life, and who are committed to ensuring her remarkable legacy is recognised.\r\n",

Most were cruelly separated from their babies after birth, and, horrifyingly, the infant mortality rate within the homes was up to five times the national average. Stolen places these Church and state-run institutions in the context of Irish history and culture, and asks how and why it took decades for the breadth of this scandal to be revealed, investigated and condemned. At the emotionally-potent centre of this somber and vital film are the survivors who are invited to tell their stories; the stories of children who grew up never knowing their families, of young people who moved from one institution to another all their lives and of mothers forced to give away their babies.",

She stages radical performances that become a new form of art and activism, but her defiance comes at a price.\r\n\r\nRaised in a small town by her grandparents, Gena leaves to study in Moscow. Through evocative performances, she protests against the government and sheds light on the persecution endured by the LGBTQ+ community. This defiant young activist faces a multitude of challenges, notably the looming threat of compulsory military conscription. Her raw vulnerability is exposed, as she searches for acceptance in a place that adamantly rejects her identity.\r\n\r\nFilmed over four years, and spanning the outbreak of war, Queendom is much more than just an artist's portrait. This visually striking yet thought-provoking film encapsulates a crucial turning point in Russia's transition from its older to younger generation.",

Wim Wenders creates a portrait of Anselm Kiefer, one of the most innovative and important painters and sculptors of our time, shot in 3D and 6K-resolution. \n\nThe film presents a total immersion in the artist’s work and practice which explores human existence and the cyclical nature of history, inspired by literature, poetry, philosophy, science, mythology and religion. For over two years, Wenders traced Kiefer’s path from his native Germany to his current home in France, connecting the stages of his life to the essential places of his career that spans more than five decades.\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: Due to an unexpected 3D glasses supply issue at Mayfair, all our Anselm 3D shows will likely be in 2D. We apologise for any inconvenience, as we work to solve the issue and get back to 3D shows as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nMayfair’s new 3D system requires special electronic 3D glasses that we intend to hand out to customers at each 3D performance. At all other venues, commonly used passive 3D glasses will be available to purchase for £1.50, or you can bring your own pair.\r\n\r\n2D performances are available at Soho, Bloomsbury, Hoxton, Richmond, Camden, Wimbledon and Knutsford.",

With his livelihood threatened, Snow is reluctantly assigned to mentor Lucy Gray Baird (Rachel Zegler), a tribute from the impoverished District 12. But after Lucy Gray’s charm captivates the audience of Panem, Snow sees an opportunity to shift their fates. With everything he has worked for hanging in the balance, Snow unites with Lucy Gray to turn the odds in their favor. Battling his instincts for both good and evil, Snow sets out on a race against time to survive and reveal if he will ultimately become a songbird or a snake.",

From lost phone numbers to mistaken addresses, alcoholism and a charming stray dog, the pair’s path to happiness is as bittersweet as it is ultimately delightful. \n\nShot through with Kaurismäki’s typically playful, idiosyncratic style and deadpan sense of humor, this tender romantic tragicomedy is both a loving tribute to the filmmaker’s beloved contemporaries and a timely reminder of the potency of movie-going from one of cinema’s living legends.

Born in the northern coastal town of South Shields, she was driven by a fierce conviction to record the impact of Thatcher era de-industrialisation upon local communities. Her striking black and white photos convey a tenderness and intimacy that set her apart from her peers and her work would become a powerful record of a world decimated by a new and ruthless form of capitalism. .\r\n \r\nThe film follows Tish’s daughter Ella as she revisits key moments from her mother’s life and work. She is accompanied by people who remained close to Tish throughout her life, and who are committed to ensuring her remarkable legacy is recognised.\r\n",

Wim Wenders creates a portrait of Anselm Kiefer, one of the most innovative and important painters and sculptors of our time, shot in 3D and 6K-resolution. \n\nThe film presents a total immersion in the artist’s work and practice which explores human existence and the cyclical nature of history, inspired by literature, poetry, philosophy, science, mythology and religion. For over two years, Wenders traced Kiefer’s path from his native Germany to his current home in France, connecting the stages of his life to the essential places of his career that spans more than five decades.\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: Due to an unexpected 3D glasses supply issue at Mayfair, all our Anselm 3D shows will likely be in 2D. We apologise for any inconvenience, as we work to solve the issue and get back to 3D shows as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nMayfair’s new 3D system requires special electronic 3D glasses that we intend to hand out to customers at each 3D performance. At all other venues, commonly used passive 3D glasses will be available to purchase for £1.50, or you can bring your own pair.\r\n\r\n2D performances are available at Soho, Bloomsbury, Hoxton, Richmond, Camden, Wimbledon and Knutsford.",

THE HUNGER GAMES: THE BALLAD OF SONGBIRDS & SNAKES follows a young Coriolanus (Tom Blyth) who is the last hope for his failing lineage, the once-proud Snow family that has fallen from grace in a post-war Capitol. With his livelihood threatened, Snow is reluctantly assigned to mentor Lucy Gray Baird (Rachel Zegler), a tribute from the impoverished District 12. But after Lucy Gray’s charm captivates the audience of Panem, Snow sees an opportunity to shift their fates. With everything he has worked for hanging in the balance, Snow unites with Lucy Gray to turn the odds in their favor. Battling his instincts for both good and evil, Snow sets out on a race against time to survive and reveal if he will ultimately become a songbird or a snake.",

From lost phone numbers to mistaken addresses, alcoholism and a charming stray dog, the pair’s path to happiness is as bittersweet as it is ultimately delightful. \n\nShot through with Kaurismäki’s typically playful, idiosyncratic style and deadpan sense of humor, this tender romantic tragicomedy is both a loving tribute to the filmmaker’s beloved contemporaries and a timely reminder of the potency of movie-going from one of cinema’s living legends.

Wim Wenders creates a portrait of Anselm Kiefer, one of the most innovative and important painters and sculptors of our time, shot in 3D and 6K-resolution. \n\nThe film presents a total immersion in the artist’s work and practice which explores human existence and the cyclical nature of history, inspired by literature, poetry, philosophy, science, mythology and religion. For over two years, Wenders traced Kiefer’s path from his native Germany to his current home in France, connecting the stages of his life to the essential places of his career that spans more than five decades.\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: Due to an unexpected 3D glasses supply issue at Mayfair, all our Anselm 3D shows will likely be in 2D. We apologise for any inconvenience, as we work to solve the issue and get back to 3D shows as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nMayfair’s new 3D system requires special electronic 3D glasses that we intend to hand out to customers at each 3D performance. At all other venues, commonly used passive 3D glasses will be available to purchase for £1.50, or you can bring your own pair.\r\n\r\n2D performances are available at Soho, Bloomsbury, Hoxton, Richmond, Camden, Wimbledon and Knutsford.",

THE HUNGER GAMES: THE BALLAD OF SONGBIRDS & SNAKES follows a young Coriolanus (Tom Blyth) who is the last hope for his failing lineage, the once-proud Snow family that has fallen from grace in a post-war Capitol. With his livelihood threatened, Snow is reluctantly assigned to mentor Lucy Gray Baird (Rachel Zegler), a tribute from the impoverished District 12. But after Lucy Gray’s charm captivates the audience of Panem, Snow sees an opportunity to shift their fates. With everything he has worked for hanging in the balance, Snow unites with Lucy Gray to turn the odds in their favor. Battling his instincts for both good and evil, Snow sets out on a race against time to survive and reveal if he will ultimately become a songbird or a snake.",

From lost phone numbers to mistaken addresses, alcoholism and a charming stray dog, the pair’s path to happiness is as bittersweet as it is ultimately delightful. \n\nShot through with Kaurismäki’s typically playful, idiosyncratic style and deadpan sense of humor, this tender romantic tragicomedy is both a loving tribute to the filmmaker’s beloved contemporaries and a timely reminder of the potency of movie-going from one of cinema’s living legends.

She stages radical performances that become a new form of art and activism, but her defiance comes at a price.\r\n\r\nRaised in a small town by her grandparents, Gena leaves to study in Moscow. Through evocative performances, she protests against the government and sheds light on the persecution endured by the LGBTQ+ community. This defiant young activist faces a multitude of challenges, notably the looming threat of compulsory military conscription. Her raw vulnerability is exposed, as she searches for acceptance in a place that adamantly rejects her identity.\r\n\r\nFilmed over four years, and spanning the outbreak of war, Queendom is much more than just an artist's portrait. This visually striking yet thought-provoking film encapsulates a crucial turning point in Russia's transition from its older to younger generation.",

With his livelihood threatened, Snow is reluctantly assigned to mentor Lucy Gray Baird (Rachel Zegler), a tribute from the impoverished District 12. But after Lucy Gray’s charm captivates the audience of Panem, Snow sees an opportunity to shift their fates. With everything he has worked for hanging in the balance, Snow unites with Lucy Gray to turn the odds in their favor. Battling his instincts for both good and evil, Snow sets out on a race against time to survive and reveal if he will ultimately become a songbird or a snake.",

From lost phone numbers to mistaken addresses, alcoholism and a charming stray dog, the pair’s path to happiness is as bittersweet as it is ultimately delightful. \n\nShot through with Kaurismäki’s typically playful, idiosyncratic style and deadpan sense of humor, this tender romantic tragicomedy is both a loving tribute to the filmmaker’s beloved contemporaries and a timely reminder of the potency of movie-going from one of cinema’s living legends.

Though he embraces this exciting new exploration, the novelty of being with a woman starts to fade when Martin begins an affair of his own, forcing Tomas to confront life decisions he may be unprepared – or unwilling – to deal with. \n\nPerceptive, intimate and unashamedly sexy, PASSAGES sees Sachs put a uniquely European spin on his usually tender style, telling a messy, modern love story that explores the complexities, contradictions and cruelties of sex and desire.",

Cohen approaches this sensitive subject gently and yet with a real joy and enthusiasm for River, Alicia and Saifa, who are trailblazing a path of acceptance for the many people across the world born with sex characteristics that don't fit the binary notions of 'male' and 'female'. This is a compelling celebration of River, Alicia and Saifa, as well as a decisive call for equality.",
