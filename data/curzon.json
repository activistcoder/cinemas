      "synopsis": "From the twisted mind of Matthew Vaughn (Kingsman franchise, Kick-Ass) comes Argylle, a razor-witted, reality-bending, globe-encircling spy thriller.\n\nBryce Dallas Howard (Jurassic World franchise) is Elly Conway, the reclusive author of a series of best-selling espionage novels, whose idea of bliss is a night at home with her computer and her cat, Alfie. But when the plots of Elly’s fictional books—which center on secret agent Argylle and his mission to unravel a global spy syndicate—begin to mirror the covert actions of a real-life spy organization, quiet evenings at home become a thing of the past.\n\nAccompanied by Aiden (Oscar® winner Sam Rockwell), a cat-allergic spy, Elly (carrying Alfie in her backpack) races across the world to stay one step ahead of the killers as the line between Elly’s fictional world and her real one begins to blur.",

Jeffrey Wright stars as Monk, a frustrated novelist who’s fed up with the establishment profiting from “Black” entertainment that relies on tired and offensive tropes. To prove his point, Monk uses a pen name to write an outlandish “Black” book of his own, a book that propels him to the heart of hypocrisy and the madness he claims to disdain.",

Eventually he forms an unlikely bond with one of them -- a damaged, brainy troublemaker (newcomer Dominic Sessa) -- and with the school’s head cook, who lost a son in Vietnam (Da’Vine Joy Randolph). With outstanding critical acclaim, The Holdovers is now the winner of 2 Golden Globes for Best Actor (Comedy) for Paul Giamatti and Best Supporting Actress for Da’Vine Joy Randolph.",

But when the plots of Elly’s fictional books—which center on secret agent Argylle and his mission to unravel a global spy syndicate—begin to mirror the covert actions of a real-life spy organization, quiet evenings at home become a thing of the past.\n\nAccompanied by Aiden (Oscar® winner Sam Rockwell), a cat-allergic spy, Elly (carrying Alfie in her backpack) races across the world to stay one step ahead of the killers as the line between Elly’s fictional world and her real one begins to blur.",

Jeffrey Wright stars as Monk, a frustrated novelist who’s fed up with the establishment profiting from “Black” entertainment that relies on tired and offensive tropes. To prove his point, Monk uses a pen name to write an outlandish “Black” book of his own, a book that propels him to the heart of hypocrisy and the madness he claims to disdain.",

With outstanding critical acclaim, The Holdovers is now the winner of 2 Golden Globes for Best Actor (Comedy) for Paul Giamatti and Best Supporting Actress for Da’Vine Joy Randolph.",

Directed by DGA award and five-time Tony award winner George C. Wolfe and starring Emmy award winner Colman Domingo, Rustin shines a long overdue spotlight on the extraordinary man who, alongside giants like the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr., Adam Clayton Powell Jr., and Ella Baker, dared to imagine a different world, and inspired a movement in a march toward freedom. Produced by Academy award winner Bruce Cohen, Higher Ground's Tonia Davis and George C.

He challenged authority, never apologized for who he was, what he believed, or who he desired. And he did not back down. He made history, and in turn, he was forgotten. Directed by DGA award and five-time Tony award winner George C. Wolfe and starring Emmy award winner Colman Domingo, Rustin shines a long overdue spotlight on the extraordinary man who, alongside giants like the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr., Adam Clayton Powell Jr., and Ella Baker, dared to imagine a different world, and inspired a movement in a march toward freedom. Produced by Academy award winner Bruce Cohen, Higher Ground's Tonia Davis and George C. Wolfe, the film features an all-star cast including Chris Rock, Glynn Turman, Jeffrey Wright and Audra McDonald.",

Accompanying a reckless British lieutenant and an American mercenary is mestizo marksman Segundo, who comes to realize, amidst rising tensions within the group, their true mission is to murderously “remove” the indigenous population.\n\nSet against stunning mountain landscapes, Chile’s Best International Feature Film entry to the 96th Academy Awards® is a visceral reckoning with national myth and the attendant violence.

It is stories like these that have made this most remarkable director a cult figure the world over.\r\n\r\nThis comprehensive portrait by director Thomas von Steinaecke explores Herzog's work, process and everyday life, bringing together rare archive materials and in-depth interviews with the man himself, as well as celebrated collaborators - including Joshua Oppenheimer, Patti Smith, Christian Bale, Nicole Kidman and his wife, Lena Herzog.",

The most heavily monitored country in the world experiences huge infringements of privacy, (self-)censorship and control, whilst systems such as 'social credit scoring' are being tested and deployed.\r\n\r\nChinese filmmaker Jialing Zhang - now living outside the country since co-directing 2019's One Child Nation - directed this eye-opening exposé remotely, with the support of filmmakers within China, who remain anonymous for their own safety.\r\n\r\nTaking China as a mirror, the film sounds an alarm about the increasing use of surveillance tools around the world - even in democratically run countries.

Eventually he forms an unlikely bond with one of them -- a damaged, brainy troublemaker (newcomer Dominic Sessa) -- and with the school’s head cook, who lost a son in Vietnam (Da’Vine Joy Randolph). With outstanding critical acclaim, The Holdovers is now the winner of 2 Golden Globes for Best Actor (Comedy) for Paul Giamatti and Best Supporting Actress for Da’Vine Joy Randolph.",

He challenged authority, never apologized for who he was, what he believed, or who he desired. And he did not back down. He made history, and in turn, he was forgotten. Directed by DGA award and five-time Tony award winner George C. Wolfe and starring Emmy award winner Colman Domingo, Rustin shines a long overdue spotlight on the extraordinary man who, alongside giants like the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr., Adam Clayton Powell Jr., and Ella Baker, dared to imagine a different world, and inspired a movement in a march toward freedom. Produced by Academy award winner Bruce Cohen, Higher Ground's Tonia Davis and George C. Wolfe, the film features an all-star cast including Chris Rock, Glynn Turman, Jeffrey Wright and Audra McDonald.",

      "synopsis": "Now a successful filmmaker, Lorna Tucker (Westwood: Punk, Icon, Activist; Amà) was once a teenage runaway sleeping rough on the streets of London. For this frank, forceful and inspiring documentary, she returns to her former haunts and speaks to current and former homeless people about why, twenty-five years later, record numbers of people are still reduced to living on Britain's streets. As we hear the life stories of extraordinary individuals, and learn how the system has both aided and failed them, this raw, intimate and unforgettable film asks: why hasn’t public policy placed this issue firmly in the past? How can we help? And what contribution can those with experience of homelessness make to putting effective solutions in place?",
