With outstanding critical acclaim, The Holdovers is now the winner of 2 Golden Globes for Best Actor (Comedy) for Paul Giamatti and Best Supporting Actress for Da’Vine Joy Randolph.",

He challenged authority, never apologized for who he was, what he believed, or who he desired. And he did not back down. He made history, and in turn, he was forgotten. Directed by DGA award and five-time Tony award winner George C. Wolfe and starring Emmy award winner Colman Domingo, Rustin shines a long overdue spotlight on the extraordinary man who, alongside giants like the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr., Adam Clayton Powell Jr., and Ella Baker, dared to imagine a different world, and inspired a movement in a march toward freedom. Produced by Academy award winner Bruce Cohen, Higher Ground's Tonia Davis and George C. Wolfe, the film features an all-star cast including Chris Rock, Glynn Turman, Jeffrey Wright and Audra McDonald.",

As the power dynamics irrevocably shift in their relationship, the couple must face the true price of success and the unnerving limits of ambition. In her feature debut, writer-director Chloe Domont weaves a taut relationship thriller, staring down the destructive gender dynamics that pit partners against each other in a world that is transforming faster than the rules can keep up. Also starring Eddie Marsan, Rich Sommer, and Sebastian De Souza, Fair Play unravels the uncomfortable collision of empowerment and ego.",

Winner of the Best Actor award at Cannes 2023, Koji Yakusho (Babel, 13 Assassins) stars as Hirayama, a contemplative middle-aged man who lives a life of modesty and serenity, spending his days balancing his job as a dutiful caretaker of Tokyo’s numerous public toilets with his passion for music, literature and photography. As we join him on his structured daily routine, a series of unexpected encounters gradually begin to reveal a hidden past that lies behind his otherwise content and harmonious life. \n\nCombining a refreshingly unstereotypical depiction of the Japanese capital with a soundtrack comprised of iconic hits from the 60s and 80s, this is a subtle, shimmering and ultimately life-affirming reflection on finding beauty in the everyday world around us. Japan’s entry for Best International Film at the 2024 Academy Awards.\n",

It is stories like these that have made this most remarkable director a cult figure the world over.\r\n\r\nThis comprehensive portrait by director Thomas von Steinaecke explores Herzog's work, process and everyday life, bringing together rare archive materials and in-depth interviews with the man himself, as well as celebrated collaborators - including Joshua Oppenheimer, Patti Smith, Christian Bale, Nicole Kidman and his wife, Lena Herzog.",

But both her methodology and her message came under criticism in the backlash from this popularity, and slowly but surely Shere was ridiculed and squeezed out of the mainstream - and eventually out of popular consciousness.\r\n\r\nDirector Nicole Newnham (Crip Camp) recovers Shere Hite from the margins of history, feminism and academia, exploring the charismatic former model's rise and fall from prominence. Using a treasure trove of archive footage, The Disappearance of Shere Hite transports viewers back to a time of great societal change and transformation around sexuality. It rediscovers a pioneer who has had an unmistakable influence on current conversations around gender and sexuality, and asks what led to Shere's erasure.",

Directed by DGA award and five-time Tony award winner George C. Wolfe and starring Emmy award winner Colman Domingo, Rustin shines a long overdue spotlight on the extraordinary man who, alongside giants like the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr., Adam Clayton Powell Jr., and Ella Baker, dared to imagine a different world, and inspired a movement in a march toward freedom. Produced by Academy award winner Bruce Cohen, Higher Ground's Tonia Davis and George C. Wolfe, the film features an all-star cast including Chris Rock, Glynn Turman, Jeffrey Wright and Audra McDonald.",

Three decades after giving up marathon swimming in exchange for a prominent career as a sports journalist, at the age of 60, Diana (four-time Academy Award nominee Annette Bening) becomes obsessed with completing an epic swim that always eluded her: the 110 mile trek from Cuba to Florida, often referred to as the “Mount Everest” of swims. Determined to become the first person to finish the swim without a shark cage, Diana goes on a thrilling, four-year journey with her best friend and coach Bonnie Stoll (two-time Academy Award winner Jodie Foster) and a dedicated sailing team. \n\n\nThe inspirational film marks the narrative directorial debut of Academy Award-winning documentary filmmakers Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (Free Solo, The Rescue). NYAD is produced by Andrew Lazar, p.g.a. and Teddy Schwarzman, p.g.a. with a screenplay by Julia Cox, adapted from the memoir \"Find a Way\" by Diana Nyad.",

But both her methodology and her message came under criticism in the backlash from this popularity, and slowly but surely Shere was ridiculed and squeezed out of the mainstream - and eventually out of popular consciousness.\r\n\r\nDirector Nicole Newnham (Crip Camp) recovers Shere Hite from the margins of history, feminism and academia, exploring the charismatic former model's rise and fall from prominence. Using a treasure trove of archive footage, The Disappearance of Shere Hite transports viewers back to a time of great societal change and transformation around sexuality. It rediscovers a pioneer who has had an unmistakable influence on current conversations around gender and sexuality, and asks what led to Shere's erasure.",

He challenged authority, never apologized for who he was, what he believed, or who he desired. And he did not back down. He made history, and in turn, he was forgotten. Directed by DGA award and five-time Tony award winner George C. Wolfe and starring Emmy award winner Colman Domingo, Rustin shines a long overdue spotlight on the extraordinary man who, alongside giants like the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr., Adam Clayton Powell Jr., and Ella Baker, dared to imagine a different world, and inspired a movement in a march toward freedom. Produced by Academy award winner Bruce Cohen, Higher Ground's Tonia Davis and George C. Wolfe, the film features an all-star cast including Chris Rock, Glynn Turman, Jeffrey Wright and Audra McDonald.",

Determined to become the first person to finish the swim without a shark cage, Diana goes on a thrilling, four-year journey with her best friend and coach Bonnie Stoll (two-time Academy Award winner Jodie Foster) and a dedicated sailing team. \n\n\nThe inspirational film marks the narrative directorial debut of Academy Award-winning documentary filmmakers Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (Free Solo, The Rescue).

Eventually he forms an unlikely bond with one of them -- a damaged, brainy troublemaker (newcomer Dominic Sessa) -- and with the school’s head cook, who lost a son in Vietnam (Da’Vine Joy Randolph). With outstanding critical acclaim, The Holdovers is now the winner of 2 Golden Globes for Best Actor (Comedy) for Paul Giamatti and Best Supporting Actress for Da’Vine Joy Randolph.",

      "synopsis": "The architect of 1963’s momentous March on Washington, Bayard Rustin was one of the greatest activists and organizers the world has ever known. He challenged authority, never apologized for who he was, what he believed, or who he desired. And he did not back down. He made history, and in turn, he was forgotten. Directed by DGA award and five-time Tony award winner George C. Wolfe and starring Emmy award winner Colman Domingo, Rustin shines a long overdue spotlight on the extraordinary man who, alongside giants like the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr., Adam Clayton Powell Jr., and Ella Baker, dared to imagine a different world, and inspired a movement in a march toward freedom. Produced by Academy award winner Bruce Cohen, Higher Ground's Tonia Davis and George C. Wolfe, the film features an all-star cast including Chris Rock, Glynn Turman, Jeffrey Wright and Audra McDonald.",

Repetition of the everyday and the never-ending skyline offer assurance and ease. Or compel you to investigate the most pressing question plaguing Londoners: what are those 200-foot metal structures dotting the city?  \r\n\r\nThis brilliant line up of London centric films captures the widely experienced emotions of anxiety, the unsettling shift into adulthood, and the dreaded \"panic years.\" One filmmaker examines why we accept things the way we do in a wry and amusing documentary, while another brings alive the historic landscape in a series of visually compelling montages. Warda Mohamed’s debut narrative intimately depicts the different ways people can grieve and the unexpected connections you can find in those solemn moments.\r\n\r\nProgramme:\r\n– Highgate 214, dir.

      "synopsis": "Feminist researcher Shere Hite changed the discussion around women's sexuality with her groundbreaking studies in the 1970s and 80s, and her books (including The Hite Report) became best-sellers. But both her methodology and her message came under criticism in the backlash from this popularity, and slowly but surely Shere was ridiculed and squeezed out of the mainstream - and eventually out of popular consciousness.\r\n\r\nDirector Nicole Newnham (Crip Camp) recovers Shere Hite from the margins of history, feminism and academia, exploring the charismatic former model's rise and fall from prominence. Using a treasure trove of archive footage, The Disappearance of Shere Hite transports viewers back to a time of great societal change and transformation around sexuality. It rediscovers a pioneer who has had an unmistakable influence on current conversations around gender and sexuality, and asks what led to Shere's erasure.",

They are homeless, sex workers, runaway teenagers. Lately, they have mostly been migrants, rejected by the Mediterranean Sea onto the shores of Italy. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n If all rights belong to the living, nothing is left to the dead. So what happens when the dead have lost their identity? In the face of this growing multitude, no one seems concerned about their right to dignity. No one but Cristina.\r\n\r\n",

As automation and artificial intelligence exceed human capacity, we will be forced to rethink the role work plays in our lives: the majority of jobs that exist today could vanish in a few decades. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe debate about the consequences of this has been dominated by technology experts and economists and often painted as a sci-fi dystopia. What is absent is the human perspective, in the sense of a look at what this will mean to us as human beings. With characters and narratives across four continents, the film seeks an existential answer to what work means today, what things could be like in the future and what will happen to us when we don’t work.
