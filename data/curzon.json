Winner of the Best Actor award at Cannes 2023, Koji Yakusho (Babel, 13 Assassins) stars as Hirayama, a contemplative middle-aged man who lives a life of modesty and serenity, spending his days balancing his job as a dutiful caretaker of Tokyo’s numerous public toilets with his passion for music, literature and photography. As we join him on his structured daily routine, a series of unexpected encounters gradually begin to reveal a hidden past that lies behind his otherwise content and harmonious life. \n\nCombining a refreshingly unstereotypical depiction of the Japanese capital with a soundtrack comprised of iconic hits from the 60s and 80s, this is a subtle, shimmering and ultimately life-affirming reflection on finding beauty in the everyday world around us. Japan’s entry for Best International Film at the 2024 Academy Awards.\n",

But those who loved her considered her an exciting cultural force, and a loving mother – and innocent of the accusations. Never-seen-before home movies and family photographs explore life with the Rolling Stones and tell a bittersweet tale of both triumph and heartbreak. From Barbarella to the Swiss Alps, and the Lower East Side to London, Anita Pallenberg was a creative force ahead of her time.",

I’m not sure how it happens, but it does. For me, that body of work is a wondrous presence, a constant source of energy, and a reminder of what life and art are all about.\"\n\nDrawing on a rich array of archive material, Scorsese explores in full the collaboration between the Englishman Powell and the Hungarian Pressburger - two romantics and idealists, who thrived in the face of adversity during World War II but were eventually brought low by the film industry of the 1950s.\n\nScorsese celebrates their ability to create \"subversive commercial movies\" and describes how deeply their films have influenced his own work.

The starting point is the recovery of a trove of reels kept in the vaults of the Yugoslav Newsreels in her hometown, Belgrade. Footage filmed by Yugoslav cameramen starting from the 1950s across a decolonising world takes us within the ranks of the Algerian Liberation Movement and FRELIMO, to newly-independent countries such as Mali and Tanzania, and the foundational gathering of the Non-Aligned Movement which took place in Belgrade in 1961. Layering this ‘resurfaced’ footage with oral histories, sound recordings and personal archives into a confessional speculation, Turajlic performs the challenges of giving voice to unfulfilled political projects. The live ‘excavation’ opens a space where she and the audience journey together exploring the poetics of the fragmentary.",

From Barbarella to the Swiss Alps, and the Lower East Side to London, Anita Pallenberg was a creative force ahead of her time.",

Part of the Official Selection of the 2023 Cannes Film Festival, Oscar-nominated Robot Dreams is the first animated film from Pablo Berger (Blancanieves).\n\nDog is lonely. He spends a lot of time by himself, whiling away long evenings in his Manhattan studio apartment, eating microwave meals for one in front of the TV. Tired of his solitary existence, he decides to purchase a friend. When his order arrives, he builds Robot, a fun-loving, happy-go-lucky companion to keep him company. Dog and Robot spend an idyllic day together – frolicking through the city to the joyful melody of Earth, Wind & Fire’s ‘September’ – ending up at Coney Island to enjoy the fun. But they are soon separated on the beach. Dog, devastated at the loss of his friend, does everything in his power to get Robot back.  \n\nSet in the 1980s, vivified by a poppy soundtrack and a strong affinity for cinema history, Robot Dreams is a deeply felt, bittersweet buddy comedy that embraces ambiguity and the uncertainty of life’s path.\n",

But those who loved her considered her an exciting cultural force, and a loving mother – and innocent of the accusations. Never-seen-before home movies and family photographs explore life with the Rolling Stones and tell a bittersweet tale of both triumph and heartbreak.

Winner of the Best Actor award at Cannes 2023, Koji Yakusho (Babel, 13 Assassins) stars as Hirayama, a contemplative middle-aged man who lives a life of modesty and serenity, spending his days balancing his job as a dutiful caretaker of Tokyo’s numerous public toilets with his passion for music, literature and photography. As we join him on his structured daily routine, a series of unexpected encounters gradually begin to reveal a hidden past that lies behind his otherwise content and harmonious life. \n\nCombining a refreshingly unstereotypical depiction of the Japanese capital with a soundtrack comprised of iconic hits from the 60s and 80s, this is a subtle, shimmering and ultimately life-affirming reflection on finding beauty in the everyday world around us. Japan’s entry for Best International Film at the 2024 Academy Awards.\n",

Part of the Official Selection of the 2023 Cannes Film Festival, Oscar-nominated Robot Dreams is the first animated film from Pablo Berger (Blancanieves).\n\nDog is lonely. He spends a lot of time by himself, whiling away long evenings in his Manhattan studio apartment, eating microwave meals for one in front of the TV. Tired of his solitary existence, he decides to purchase a friend. When his order arrives, he builds Robot, a fun-loving, happy-go-lucky companion to keep him company. Dog and Robot spend an idyllic day together – frolicking through the city to the joyful melody of Earth, Wind & Fire’s ‘September’ – ending up at Coney Island to enjoy the fun. But they are soon separated on the beach. Dog, devastated at the loss of his friend, does everything in his power to get Robot back.  \n\nSet in the 1980s, vivified by a poppy soundtrack and a strong affinity for cinema history, Robot Dreams is a deeply felt, bittersweet buddy comedy that embraces ambiguity and the uncertainty of life’s path.\n",

But those who loved her considered her an exciting cultural force, and a loving mother – and innocent of the accusations. Never-seen-before home movies and family photographs explore life with the Rolling Stones and tell a bittersweet tale of both triumph and heartbreak. From Barbarella to the Swiss Alps, and the Lower East Side to London, Anita Pallenberg was a creative force ahead of her time.",

As we join him on his structured daily routine, a series of unexpected encounters gradually begin to reveal a hidden past that lies behind his otherwise content and harmonious life. \n\nCombining a refreshingly unstereotypical depiction of the Japanese capital with a soundtrack comprised of iconic hits from the 60s and 80s, this is a subtle, shimmering and ultimately life-affirming reflection on finding beauty in the everyday world around us. Japan’s entry for Best International Film at the 2024 Academy Awards.\n",

Part of the Official Selection of the 2023 Cannes Film Festival, Oscar-nominated Robot Dreams is the first animated film from Pablo Berger (Blancanieves).\n\nDog is lonely. He spends a lot of time by himself, whiling away long evenings in his Manhattan studio apartment, eating microwave meals for one in front of the TV. Tired of his solitary existence, he decides to purchase a friend. When his order arrives, he builds Robot, a fun-loving, happy-go-lucky companion to keep him company. Dog and Robot spend an idyllic day together – frolicking through the city to the joyful melody of Earth, Wind & Fire’s ‘September’ – ending up at Coney Island to enjoy the fun. But they are soon separated on the beach. Dog, devastated at the loss of his friend, does everything in his power to get Robot back.  \n\nSet in the 1980s, vivified by a poppy soundtrack and a strong affinity for cinema history, Robot Dreams is a deeply felt, bittersweet buddy comedy that embraces ambiguity and the uncertainty of life’s path.\n",

It received ecstatic praise at its premiere, acclaimed by critics and audiences alike for its intelligent and emotionally powerful storytelling through exquisite dance. With striking designs by Bob Crowley and atmospheric music by Joby Talbot, The Winter’s Tale is widely considered a modern ballet classic\n\nThe story follows the destruction of a marriage through consuming jealousy, the abandonment of a child, and a seemingly hopeless love. Yet, through remorse and regret – and the apparent miracle of a statue coming to life – the ending is uplifting as it brings forgiveness and reconciliation. The two lands between which the drama unfolds are vividly portrayed in movement, sound and image. The Sicilia of King Leontes grows in threatening coolness and darkness, while the Bohemia of King Polixenes is a pastoral idyll of lyricism and sun-saturated colour.",

Winner of the Best Actor award at Cannes 2023, Koji Yakusho (Babel, 13 Assassins) stars as Hirayama, a contemplative middle-aged man who lives a life of modesty and serenity, spending his days balancing his job as a dutiful caretaker of Tokyo’s numerous public toilets with his passion for music, literature and photography. As we join him on his structured daily routine, a series of unexpected encounters gradually begin to reveal a hidden past that lies behind his otherwise content and harmonious life. \n\nCombining a refreshingly unstereotypical depiction of the Japanese capital with a soundtrack comprised of iconic hits from the 60s and 80s, this is a subtle, shimmering and ultimately life-affirming reflection on finding beauty in the everyday world around us.

Part of the Official Selection of the 2023 Cannes Film Festival, Oscar-nominated Robot Dreams is the first animated film from Pablo Berger (Blancanieves).\n\nDog is lonely. He spends a lot of time by himself, whiling away long evenings in his Manhattan studio apartment, eating microwave meals for one in front of the TV. Tired of his solitary existence, he decides to purchase a friend. When his order arrives, he builds Robot, a fun-loving, happy-go-lucky companion to keep him company. Dog and Robot spend an idyllic day together – frolicking through the city to the joyful melody of Earth, Wind & Fire’s ‘September’ – ending up at Coney Island to enjoy the fun. But they are soon separated on the beach. Dog, devastated at the loss of his friend, does everything in his power to get Robot back.  \n\nSet in the 1980s, vivified by a poppy soundtrack and a strong affinity for cinema history, Robot Dreams is a deeply felt, bittersweet buddy comedy that embraces ambiguity and the uncertainty of life’s path.\n",

She was touted as a 'voodoo priestess' and an 'evil seductress', accused of trying to break up the Rolling Stones.\r\n\r\nDrawing on words from her unpublished memoir, narrated by Scarlett Johansson, this intimate portrait  explores Anita's life as she saw it herself, drawing us deep into her world, with the help of a supporting cast that includes her family - Marlon, Angela, and their father Keith Richards.  \r\n\r\nNever-seen-before home movies and family photographs explore life with the Rolling Stones, in a bittersweet tale of both triumph and heartbreak. From Barbarella to the Swiss Alps, and the Lower East Side to London, Anita Pallenberg was a creative force ahead of her time.",

Part of the Official Selection of the 2023 Cannes Film Festival, Oscar-nominated Robot Dreams is the first animated film from Pablo Berger (Blancanieves).\n\nDog is lonely. He spends a lot of time by himself, whiling away long evenings in his Manhattan studio apartment, eating microwave meals for one in front of the TV. Tired of his solitary existence, he decides to purchase a friend. When his order arrives, he builds Robot, a fun-loving, happy-go-lucky companion to keep him company. Dog and Robot spend an idyllic day together – frolicking through the city to the joyful melody of Earth, Wind & Fire’s ‘September’ – ending up at Coney Island to enjoy the fun. But they are soon separated on the beach. Dog, devastated at the loss of his friend, does everything in his power to get Robot back.  \n\nSet in the 1980s, vivified by a poppy soundtrack and a strong affinity for cinema history, Robot Dreams is a deeply felt, bittersweet buddy comedy that embraces ambiguity and the uncertainty of life’s path.\n",

But those who loved her considered her an exciting cultural force, and a loving mother – and innocent of the accusations. Never-seen-before home movies and family photographs explore life with the Rolling Stones and tell a bittersweet tale of both triumph and heartbreak.

Winner of the Best Actor award at Cannes 2023, Koji Yakusho (Babel, 13 Assassins) stars as Hirayama, a contemplative middle-aged man who lives a life of modesty and serenity, spending his days balancing his job as a dutiful caretaker of Tokyo’s numerous public toilets with his passion for music, literature and photography. As we join him on his structured daily routine, a series of unexpected encounters gradually begin to reveal a hidden past that lies behind his otherwise content and harmonious life. \n\nCombining a refreshingly unstereotypical depiction of the Japanese capital with a soundtrack comprised of iconic hits from the 60s and 80s, this is a subtle, shimmering and ultimately life-affirming reflection on finding beauty in the everyday world around us. Japan’s entry for Best International Film at the 2024 Academy Awards.\n",

While the distraught Mortara family fight to get him back, they find themselves at the epicentre of a wider historical battle between the forces of Catholic authoritarianism and the growing opposition movement.

Evenings here are spent in darkness except for a few small solar lamps.\r\n\r\nBut electrification is a surprisingly long process; a haphazard and absurd affair which stops and starts, and seems to take forever. 96-year-old Khamrang has been let down before and thinks that nothing will change, whereas shopkeeper Jasmine dreams so fervently of buying a refrigerator, she can almost taste the ice cream she will sell if power ever flows to the village.\r\n\r\nAs Khamrang, Jasmine and the rest of Tora wait to find out if electricity will arrive and transform everything, life flickers between hope and frustration, humor the only constant.",

Six years before her\r\ndeath, a wealthy gallerist, Judith Alexander, 'discovered' her and introduced her work to the art world.\r\n\r\nOver four acts and an interlude, This World is Not My Own traces the lifespan of an outsider artist, while exploring the personal and political events that shaped her singular body of work. The film mixes lively interviews with Nellie May's family and friends, with 3D animations of Nellie May and Judith Alexander, shot in intricately detailed sets, to bring her dynamic story to life.",

Part of the Official Selection of the 2023 Cannes Film Festival, Oscar-nominated Robot Dreams is the first animated film from Pablo Berger (Blancanieves).\n\nDog is lonely. He spends a lot of time by himself, whiling away long evenings in his Manhattan studio apartment, eating microwave meals for one in front of the TV. Tired of his solitary existence, he decides to purchase a friend. When his order arrives, he builds Robot, a fun-loving, happy-go-lucky companion to keep him company. Dog and Robot spend an idyllic day together – frolicking through the city to the joyful melody of Earth, Wind & Fire’s ‘September’ – ending up at Coney Island to enjoy the fun. But they are soon separated on the beach. Dog, devastated at the loss of his friend, does everything in his power to get Robot back.  \n\nSet in the 1980s, vivified by a poppy soundtrack and a strong affinity for cinema history, Robot Dreams is a deeply felt, bittersweet buddy comedy that embraces ambiguity and the uncertainty of life’s path.\n",

As we join him on his structured daily routine, a series of unexpected encounters gradually begin to reveal a hidden past that lies behind his otherwise content and harmonious life. \n\nCombining a refreshingly unstereotypical depiction of the Japanese capital with a soundtrack comprised of iconic hits from the 60s and 80s, this is a subtle, shimmering and ultimately life-affirming reflection on finding beauty in the everyday world around us.

Six years before her\r\ndeath, a wealthy gallerist, Judith Alexander, 'discovered' her and introduced her work to the art world.\r\n\r\nOver four acts and an interlude, This World is Not My Own traces the lifespan of an outsider artist, while exploring the personal and political events that shaped her singular body of work. The film mixes lively interviews with Nellie May's family and friends, with 3D animations of Nellie May and Judith Alexander, shot in intricately detailed sets, to bring her dynamic story to life.",

      "synopsis": "An unapologetic rock ‘n’ roller, an actress, a muse and a mother - amongst many other things Anita Pallenberg was also a woman whose life often became newspaper headlines. She was touted as a 'voodoo priestess' and an 'evil seductress', accused of trying to break up the Rolling Stones.\r\n\r\nDrawing on words from her unpublished memoir, narrated by Scarlett Johansson, this intimate portrait  explores Anita's life as she saw it herself, drawing us deep into her world, with the help of a supporting cast that includes her family - Marlon, Angela, and their father Keith Richards.  \r\n\r\nNever-seen-before home movies and family photographs explore life with the Rolling Stones, in a bittersweet tale of both triumph and heartbreak. From Barbarella to the Swiss Alps, and the Lower East Side to London, Anita Pallenberg was a creative force ahead of her time.",

      "synopsis": "Martin Scorsese first encountered the films of Powell and Pressburger when he was a child, sitting in front of the family TV. When their famous logo came up on screen, Scorsese says, \"You knew you were in for fantasy, wonder, magic - real film magic.\"\r\n\r\nNow, he tells the story of his lifelong love-affair with their movies, including The Red Shoes, The Life and Death Of Colonel Blimp, Black Narcissus, and The Tales of Hoffmann.\r\n\r\nDrawing on a rich array of archive material, Scorsese explores in full the collaboration between the Englishman Powell and the Hungarian Pressburger - two romantics and idealists, who thrived in the face of adversity during World War II but were eventually brought low by the film industry of the 1950s.\r\n\r\nIn this intimate, personal celebration of their films, Scorsese celebrates Powell and Pressburger's ability to create \"subversive commercial movies\" and describes how deeply their films have influenced his own work.",
