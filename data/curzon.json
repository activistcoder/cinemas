But after Lucy Gray’s charm captivates the audience of Panem, Snow sees an opportunity to shift their fates. With everything he has worked for hanging in the balance, Snow unites with Lucy Gray to turn the odds in their favor.

By doing that, she wants to change people’s perception of beauty and queerness and bring attention to the harassment of the LGBTQ+ community. The performances - often dark, strange, evocative, and queer at their core - are a manifestation of Gena’s subconscious. But they come at a price.",

From lost phone numbers to mistaken addresses, alcoholism and a charming stray dog, the pair’s path to happiness is as bittersweet as it is ultimately delightful. \n\nShot through with Kaurismäki’s typically playful, idiosyncratic style and deadpan sense of humor, this tender romantic tragicomedy is both a loving tribute to the filmmaker’s beloved contemporaries and a timely reminder of the potency of movie-going from one of cinema’s living legends.

      "synopsis": "Based on the book of the same name by literary powerhouse Ottessa Moshfegh, Eileen follows a peculiar young woman whose dreary life stretches on toward unending misery. In frigid 1960s Boston, Eileen (Thomasin McKenzie) shuffles between her father’s dingy, emotionally haunted home and the prison where she works alongside colleagues who have ostracized her. When an intoxicating woman (Anne Hathaway) joins the prison staff, Eileen is taken. Just when the possibility of a salvational friendship (or maybe more) takes hold and forms a singular glimmer in Eileen’s darkness, her newfound confidant entangles her in a shocking crime that alters all.",

THE HUNGER GAMES: THE BALLAD OF SONGBIRDS & SNAKES follows a young Coriolanus (Tom Blyth) who is the last hope for his failing lineage, the once-proud Snow family that has fallen from grace in a post-war Capitol. With his livelihood threatened, Snow is reluctantly assigned to mentor Lucy Gray Baird (Rachel Zegler), a tribute from the impoverished District 12. But after Lucy Gray’s charm captivates the audience of Panem, Snow sees an opportunity to shift their fates. With everything he has worked for hanging in the balance, Snow unites with Lucy Gray to turn the odds in their favor. Battling his instincts for both good and evil, Snow sets out on a race against time to survive and reveal if he will ultimately become a songbird or a snake.",

      "synopsis": "Award-winning filmmaker Aki Kaurismäki (Le Havre, The Other Side of Hope) makes a masterful return with FALLEN LEAVES, a timeless, hopeful and satisfying love story that won the Jury Prize at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival.\n\nSet in modern day Helsinki, the film tells the story of Ansa (Alma Pöysti) and Holappa (Jussi Vatanen), two lonely souls whose chance meeting at a local karaoke bar is beset by numerous hurdles. From lost phone numbers to mistaken addresses, alcoholism and a charming stray dog, the pair’s path to happiness is as bittersweet as it is ultimately delightful. \n\nShot through with Kaurismäki’s typically playful, idiosyncratic style and deadpan sense of humor, this tender romantic tragicomedy is both a loving tribute to the filmmaker’s beloved contemporaries and a timely reminder of the potency of movie-going from one of cinema’s living legends.

With his livelihood threatened, Snow is reluctantly assigned to mentor Lucy Gray Baird (Rachel Zegler), a tribute from the impoverished District 12. But after Lucy Gray’s charm captivates the audience of Panem, Snow sees an opportunity to shift their fates. With everything he has worked for hanging in the balance, Snow unites with Lucy Gray to turn the odds in their favor. Battling his instincts for both good and evil, Snow sets out on a race against time to survive and reveal if he will ultimately become a songbird or a snake.",

In frigid 1960s Boston, Eileen (Thomasin McKenzie) shuffles between her father’s dingy, emotionally haunted home and the prison where she works alongside colleagues who have ostracized her. When an intoxicating woman (Anne Hathaway) joins the prison staff, Eileen is taken. Just when the possibility of a salvational friendship (or maybe more) takes hold and forms a singular glimmer in Eileen’s darkness, her newfound confidant entangles her in a shocking crime that alters all.",

Wim Wenders creates a portrait of Anselm Kiefer, one of the most innovative and important painters and sculptors of our time, shot in 3D and 6K-resolution. \n\nThe film presents a total immersion in the artist’s work and practice which explores human existence and the cyclical nature of history, inspired by literature, poetry, philosophy, science, mythology and religion. For over two years, Wenders traced Kiefer’s path from his native Germany to his current home in France, connecting the stages of his life to the essential places of his career that spans more than five decades.\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: Due to an unexpected 3D glasses supply issue at Mayfair, all our Anselm 3D shows will likely be in 2D. We apologise for any inconvenience, as we work to solve the issue and get back to 3D shows as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nMayfair’s new 3D system requires special electronic 3D glasses that we intend to hand out to customers at each 3D performance. At all other venues, commonly used passive 3D glasses will be available to purchase for £1.50, or you can bring your own pair.\r\n\r\n2D performances are available at Soho, Bloomsbury, Hoxton, Richmond, Camden, Wimbledon and Knutsford.",

From lost phone numbers to mistaken addresses, alcoholism and a charming stray dog, the pair’s path to happiness is as bittersweet as it is ultimately delightful. \n\nShot through with Kaurismäki’s typically playful, idiosyncratic style and deadpan sense of humor, this tender romantic tragicomedy is both a loving tribute to the filmmaker’s beloved contemporaries and a timely reminder of the potency of movie-going from one of cinema’s living legends.

      "synopsis": "Take a celebrated musical genius, some sibling rivalry, an unknown manuscript, BAFTA-winning filmmaker Sheila Hayman, and one sensational revelation and what have you got? Fanny: The Other Mendelssohn – revelatory new feature documentary starring global Decca star, Isata Kanneh-Mason.\nFelix Mendelssohn’s Wedding March may be the best-known classical composition of all time. But Felix was not the only genius in the family. His sister, Fanny was also a brilliant composer. But Fanny was equal to any of her contemporaries, male or female; technically brilliant and boldly ground-breaking. Tragically, the resulting joy and recognition were short-lived. Less than a year later, Fanny died, and shortly afterwards Felix too. But today Fanny's music is beginning to get the recognition it deserves. \nOver a century later, in 1971, the famous pianist Eric Heidsieck was contacted by a record company and asked to produce the first recording of Mendelssohn’s Easter Sonata. It was presumed to be the work of Felix. But in an amazing plot twist, captured as it happened in this extraordinary film, it is once and for all proven definitively to be Fanny’s own piano masterpiece, written when she was only 22. Fanny’s music is brought to life by the gifted virtuoso pianist, Isata Kanneh-Mason, recipient of the 2021 Leonard Bernstein Award and 2021 best classical artist at the Global Awards. And as she discovers the Easter Sonata, the parallels between her life and Fanny’s – including the challenge of being a pioneer with few role models in classical music – become clear.\nDirected by the unheralded composer’s great great great granddaughter, it is moving as it is joyous. This is the story of a very modern woman – who just happened to live 200 years ago.",

From lost phone numbers to mistaken addresses, alcoholism and a charming stray dog, the pair’s path to happiness is as bittersweet as it is ultimately delightful. \n\nShot through with Kaurismäki’s typically playful, idiosyncratic style and deadpan sense of humor, this tender romantic tragicomedy is both a loving tribute to the filmmaker’s beloved contemporaries and a timely reminder of the potency of movie-going from one of cinema’s living legends.

For over two years, Wenders traced Kiefer’s path from his native Germany to his current home in France, connecting the stages of his life to the essential places of his career that spans more than five decades.\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: Due to an unexpected 3D glasses supply issue at Mayfair, all our Anselm 3D shows will likely be in 2D. We apologise for any inconvenience, as we work to solve the issue and get back to 3D shows as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nMayfair’s new 3D system requires special electronic 3D glasses that we intend to hand out to customers at each 3D performance. At all other venues, commonly used passive 3D glasses will be available to purchase for £1.50, or you can bring your own pair.\r\n\r\n2D performances are available at Soho, Bloomsbury, Hoxton, Richmond, Camden, Wimbledon and Knutsford.",

      "synopsis": "Based on the book of the same name by literary powerhouse Ottessa Moshfegh, Eileen follows a peculiar young woman whose dreary life stretches on toward unending misery. In frigid 1960s Boston, Eileen (Thomasin McKenzie) shuffles between her father’s dingy, emotionally haunted home and the prison where she works alongside colleagues who have ostracized her. When an intoxicating woman (Anne Hathaway) joins the prison staff, Eileen is taken. Just when the possibility of a salvational friendship (or maybe more) takes hold and forms a singular glimmer in Eileen’s darkness, her newfound confidant entangles her in a shocking crime that alters all.",

THE HUNGER GAMES: THE BALLAD OF SONGBIRDS & SNAKES follows a young Coriolanus (Tom Blyth) who is the last hope for his failing lineage, the once-proud Snow family that has fallen from grace in a post-war Capitol. With his livelihood threatened, Snow is reluctantly assigned to mentor Lucy Gray Baird (Rachel Zegler), a tribute from the impoverished District 12. But after Lucy Gray’s charm captivates the audience of Panem, Snow sees an opportunity to shift their fates. With everything he has worked for hanging in the balance, Snow unites with Lucy Gray to turn the odds in their favor. Battling his instincts for both good and evil, Snow sets out on a race against time to survive and reveal if he will ultimately become a songbird or a snake.",

From lost phone numbers to mistaken addresses, alcoholism and a charming stray dog, the pair’s path to happiness is as bittersweet as it is ultimately delightful. \n\nShot through with Kaurismäki’s typically playful, idiosyncratic style and deadpan sense of humor, this tender romantic tragicomedy is both a loving tribute to the filmmaker’s beloved contemporaries and a timely reminder of the potency of movie-going from one of cinema’s living legends.

For over two years, Wenders traced Kiefer’s path from his native Germany to his current home in France, connecting the stages of his life to the essential places of his career that spans more than five decades.\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: Due to an unexpected 3D glasses supply issue at Mayfair, all our Anselm 3D shows will likely be in 2D. We apologise for any inconvenience, as we work to solve the issue and get back to 3D shows as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nMayfair’s new 3D system requires special electronic 3D glasses that we intend to hand out to customers at each 3D performance. At all other venues, commonly used passive 3D glasses will be available to purchase for £1.50, or you can bring your own pair.\r\n\r\n2D performances are available at Soho, Bloomsbury, Hoxton, Richmond, Camden, Wimbledon and Knutsford.",

The performances - often dark, strange, evocative, and queer at their core - are a manifestation of Gena’s subconscious. But they come at a price.",

Over four seasons, we follow his well worn walking boots on a trek through vistas of mountain valleys, glaciers and fjords, as he contemplates life, love, nature and his place in the world.\r\n\r\nThis unique cinematic experience casts human time in the perspective of natural time, becoming a meditation that rewards big screen viewing.",

      "synopsis": "An Indian farmer takes on the fight of his life when, against tradition and expectation, he demands justice for his daughter and long-lasting change for their community.\r\n\r\nAfter his 13-year-old daughter is sexually assaulted by men from their village, Ranjit, a rice farmer, accompanies her to the police to report her attackers. The neighbours and the village are against them, and the family must muster all their strength and defiance to navigate the labyrinth of India's courts, amidst village disapproval, threats of violence and mounting tensions.\r\n\r\nWith tremendous access to all facets of this story, To Kill a Tiger is an astutely observed and courageous examination of societal misogyny, and a source of hope for survivors in India. Winning multiple awards at film festivals across the world including Toronto and Palm Springs, it show's how one family's strength can force a social reckoning that will reverberate for years to come.\r\n\r\nTo Kill a Tiger deals with highly sensitive subject matter and contains depictions of sexual violence, which may be triggering for some viewers.",

      "synopsis": "Director Agniia Galdanova points her camera on Putin's Russia, unveiling the harsh repercussions faced by those who stray from societal norms.\r\n\r\n21-year-old Gena is a queer performance artist who transforms the streets of Russia into her runway, confronting the public with her other-wordly, extravagant costumes. She stages radical performances that become a new form of art and activism, but her defiance comes at a price.\r\n\r\nRaised in a small town by her grandparents, Gena leaves to study in Moscow. Through evocative performances, she protests against the government and sheds light on the persecution endured by the LGBTQ+ community. This defiant young activist faces a multitude of challenges, notably the looming threat of compulsory military conscription. Her raw vulnerability is exposed, as she searches for acceptance in a place that adamantly rejects her identity.\r\n\r\nFilmed over four years, and spanning the outbreak of war, Queendom is much more than just an artist's portrait. This visually striking yet thought-provoking film encapsulates a crucial turning point in Russia's transition from its older to younger generation.",

As conventional norms of the time challenge their undeniable attraction, an honest story emerges to reveal the resilience of the heart in the face of change. A young woman in her 20s, Therese Belivet (Rooney Mara), is a clerk working in a Manhattan department store and dreaming of a more fulfilling life when she meets Carol (Cate Blanchett), an alluring woman trapped in a loveless, convenient marriage. As an immediate connection sparks between them, the innocence of their first encounter dims and their connection deepens. While Carol breaks free from the confines of marriage, her husband (Kyle Chandler) begins to question her competence as a mother as her involvement with Therese and close relationship with her best friend Abby (Sarah Paulson) come to light.",

At the emotionally-potent centre of this somber and vital film are the survivors who are invited to tell their stories; the stories of children who grew up never knowing their families, of young people who moved from one institution to another all their lives and of mothers forced to give away their babies.",
