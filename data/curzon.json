Winner of the Best Actor award at Cannes 2023, Koji Yakusho (Babel, 13 Assassins) stars as Hirayama, a contemplative middle-aged man who lives a life of modesty and serenity, spending his days balancing his job as a dutiful caretaker of Tokyo’s numerous public toilets with his passion for music, literature and photography. As we join him on his structured daily routine, a series of unexpected encounters gradually begin to reveal a hidden past that lies behind his otherwise content and harmonious life. \n\nCombining a refreshingly unstereotypical depiction of the Japanese capital with a soundtrack comprised of iconic hits from the 60s and 80s, this is a subtle, shimmering and ultimately life-affirming reflection on finding beauty in the everyday world around us. Japan’s entry for Best International Film at the 2024 Academy Awards.\n",

Part of the Official Selection of the 2023 Cannes Film Festival, Oscar-nominated Robot Dreams is the first animated film from Pablo Berger (Blancanieves).\n\nDog is lonely. He spends a lot of time by himself, whiling away long evenings in his Manhattan studio apartment, eating microwave meals for one in front of the TV. Tired of his solitary existence, he decides to purchase a friend. When his order arrives, he builds Robot, a fun-loving, happy-go-lucky companion to keep him company. Dog and Robot spend an idyllic day together – frolicking through the city to the joyful melody of Earth, Wind & Fire’s ‘September’ – ending up at Coney Island to enjoy the fun. But they are soon separated on the beach. Dog, devastated at the loss of his friend, does everything in his power to get Robot back.  \n\nSet in the 1980s, vivified by a poppy soundtrack and a strong affinity for cinema history, Robot Dreams is a deeply felt, bittersweet buddy comedy that embraces ambiguity and the uncertainty of life’s path.\n",

I’m not sure how it happens, but it does. For me, that body of work is a wondrous presence, a constant source of energy, and a reminder of what life and art are all about.\"\n\nDrawing on a rich array of archive material, Scorsese explores in full the collaboration between the Englishman Powell and the Hungarian Pressburger - two romantics and idealists, who thrived in the face of adversity during World War II but were eventually brought low by the film industry of the 1950s.\n\nScorsese celebrates their ability to create \"subversive commercial movies\" and describes how deeply their films have influenced his own work.

As we join him on his structured daily routine, a series of unexpected encounters gradually begin to reveal a hidden past that lies behind his otherwise content and harmonious life. \n\nCombining a refreshingly unstereotypical depiction of the Japanese capital with a soundtrack comprised of iconic hits from the 60s and 80s, this is a subtle, shimmering and ultimately life-affirming reflection on finding beauty in the everyday world around us.

It soon becomes clear that his greatest sources of nourishment are literature and theatre. And he sees in his nephew, who is also gay, a like-minded creative soul. Between the Shakespearean monologues, Much Ado About Dying presents an intimate, occasionally funny and ultimately moving portrait of a solitary life and a quietly critical assessment of the inadequate resources available in the UK for a rapidly ageing population.",

This previously elusive milestone of British comedy is now newly restored in 2k from original 16mm materials.",

When their famous logo came up on screen, Scorsese says, \"You knew you were in for fantasy, wonder, magic - real film magic.\"\n\nNow, in this documentary, he tells the story of his lifelong love-affair with their movies, including The Red Shoes, The Life and Death Of Colonel Blimp, Black Narcissus, and The Tales of Hoffmann.\n\n\"Certain films you simply run all the time and you live with them,\" Scorsese says. \"As you grow older they grow deeper. I’m not sure how it happens, but it does. For me, that body of work is a wondrous presence, a constant source of energy, and a reminder of what life and art are all about.\"\n\nDrawing on a rich array of archive material, Scorsese explores in full the collaboration between the Englishman Powell and the Hungarian Pressburger - two romantics and idealists, who thrived in the face of adversity during World War II but were eventually brought low by the film industry of the 1950s.\n\nScorsese celebrates their ability to create \"subversive commercial movies\" and describes how deeply their films have influenced his own work.

As we join him on his structured daily routine, a series of unexpected encounters gradually begin to reveal a hidden past that lies behind his otherwise content and harmonious life. \n\nCombining a refreshingly unstereotypical depiction of the Japanese capital with a soundtrack comprised of iconic hits from the 60s and 80s, this is a subtle, shimmering and ultimately life-affirming reflection on finding beauty in the everyday world around us. Japan’s entry for Best International Film at the 2024 Academy Awards.\n",

Amidst the upheaval and tragedy, they face a pivotal decision - to abandon everything, or to forge ahead through the series of crises that ensue.\r\n\r\nDancing on the Edge of a Volcano captures the resilience of this group of collaborators in the face of adversity, and their certainty in the transformative power of cinema, even in crisis. It shows the Lebanese capital from the perspective of the people who live there, and reminds us of the human capacity to make meaning in chaos.",

Nevertheless, his health has deteriorated in recent years. He lives in an unsuitable flat, sustaining himself on cans of soup, keeping himself warm with a small army of electric heaters and battling a mice infestation with toothpaste. It soon becomes clear that his greatest sources of nourishment are literature and theatre. And he sees in his nephew, who is also gay, a like-minded creative soul. Between the Shakespearean monologues, Much Ado About Dying presents an intimate, occasionally funny and ultimately moving portrait of a solitary life and a quietly critical assessment of the inadequate resources available in the UK for a rapidly ageing population.",

Part of the Official Selection of the 2023 Cannes Film Festival, Oscar-nominated Robot Dreams is the first animated film from Pablo Berger (Blancanieves).\n\nDog is lonely. He spends a lot of time by himself, whiling away long evenings in his Manhattan studio apartment, eating microwave meals for one in front of the TV. Tired of his solitary existence, he decides to purchase a friend. When his order arrives, he builds Robot, a fun-loving, happy-go-lucky companion to keep him company. Dog and Robot spend an idyllic day together – frolicking through the city to the joyful melody of Earth, Wind & Fire’s ‘September’ – ending up at Coney Island to enjoy the fun. But they are soon separated on the beach. Dog, devastated at the loss of his friend, does everything in his power to get Robot back.  \n\nSet in the 1980s, vivified by a poppy soundtrack and a strong affinity for cinema history, Robot Dreams is a deeply felt, bittersweet buddy comedy that embraces ambiguity and the uncertainty of life’s path.\n",

When their famous logo came up on screen, Scorsese says, \"You knew you were in for fantasy, wonder, magic - real film magic.\"\n\nNow, in this documentary, he tells the story of his lifelong love-affair with their movies, including The Red Shoes, The Life and Death Of Colonel Blimp, Black Narcissus, and The Tales of Hoffmann.\n\n\"Certain films you simply run all the time and you live with them,\" Scorsese says. \"As you grow older they grow deeper. I’m not sure how it happens, but it does. For me, that body of work is a wondrous presence, a constant source of energy, and a reminder of what life and art are all about.\"\n\nDrawing on a rich array of archive material, Scorsese explores in full the collaboration between the Englishman Powell and the Hungarian Pressburger - two romantics and idealists, who thrived in the face of adversity during World War II but were eventually brought low by the film industry of the 1950s.\n\nScorsese celebrates their ability to create \"subversive commercial movies\" and describes how deeply their films have influenced his own work.

Winner of the Best Actor award at Cannes 2023, Koji Yakusho (Babel, 13 Assassins) stars as Hirayama, a contemplative middle-aged man who lives a life of modesty and serenity, spending his days balancing his job as a dutiful caretaker of Tokyo’s numerous public toilets with his passion for music, literature and photography. As we join him on his structured daily routine, a series of unexpected encounters gradually begin to reveal a hidden past that lies behind his otherwise content and harmonious life. \n\nCombining a refreshingly unstereotypical depiction of the Japanese capital with a soundtrack comprised of iconic hits from the 60s and 80s, this is a subtle, shimmering and ultimately life-affirming reflection on finding beauty in the everyday world around us. Japan’s entry for Best International Film at the 2024 Academy Awards.\n",

It soon becomes clear that his greatest sources of nourishment are literature and theatre. And he sees in his nephew, who is also gay, a like-minded creative soul. Between the Shakespearean monologues, Much Ado About Dying presents an intimate, occasionally funny and ultimately moving portrait of a solitary life and a quietly critical assessment of the inadequate resources available in the UK for a rapidly ageing population.",

Part of the Official Selection of the 2023 Cannes Film Festival, Oscar-nominated Robot Dreams is the first animated film from Pablo Berger (Blancanieves).\n\nDog is lonely. He spends a lot of time by himself, whiling away long evenings in his Manhattan studio apartment, eating microwave meals for one in front of the TV. Tired of his solitary existence, he decides to purchase a friend. When his order arrives, he builds Robot, a fun-loving, happy-go-lucky companion to keep him company. Dog and Robot spend an idyllic day together – frolicking through the city to the joyful melody of Earth, Wind & Fire’s ‘September’ – ending up at Coney Island to enjoy the fun. But they are soon separated on the beach. Dog, devastated at the loss of his friend, does everything in his power to get Robot back.  \n\nSet in the 1980s, vivified by a poppy soundtrack and a strong affinity for cinema history, Robot Dreams is a deeply felt, bittersweet buddy comedy that embraces ambiguity and the uncertainty of life’s path.\n",

As we join him on his structured daily routine, a series of unexpected encounters gradually begin to reveal a hidden past that lies behind his otherwise content and harmonious life. \n\nCombining a refreshingly unstereotypical depiction of the Japanese capital with a soundtrack comprised of iconic hits from the 60s and 80s, this is a subtle, shimmering and ultimately life-affirming reflection on finding beauty in the everyday world around us.

As we join him on his structured daily routine, a series of unexpected encounters gradually begin to reveal a hidden past that lies behind his otherwise content and harmonious life. \n\nCombining a refreshingly unstereotypical depiction of the Japanese capital with a soundtrack comprised of iconic hits from the 60s and 80s, this is a subtle, shimmering and ultimately life-affirming reflection on finding beauty in the everyday world around us.

It soon becomes clear that his greatest sources of nourishment are literature and theatre. And he sees in his nephew, who is also gay, a like-minded creative soul.

Amidst the upheaval and tragedy, they face a pivotal decision - to abandon everything, or to forge ahead through the series of crises that ensue.\r\n\r\nDancing on the Edge of a Volcano captures the resilience of this group of collaborators in the face of adversity, and their certainty in the transformative power of cinema, even in crisis. It shows the Lebanese capital from the perspective of the people who live there, and reminds us of the human capacity to make meaning in chaos.",

But those who loved her considered her an exciting cultural force, and a loving mother – and innocent of the accusations. Never-seen-before home movies and family photographs explore life with the Rolling Stones and tell a bittersweet tale of both triumph and heartbreak. From Barbarella to the Swiss Alps, and the Lower East Side to London, Anita Pallenberg was a creative force ahead of her time.",
