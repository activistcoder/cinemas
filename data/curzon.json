Some may know that the festival began its life as the Halloween Society, an itinerant London film club co-founded by Philip Ilson in 1994; one of many underground, alternative film collectives across the capital and across the decade.  \r\n\r\n\r\nPositioned firmly outside of the mainstream, the filmmakers that emerged from the scene nevertheless began to receive funding from the BFI, Channel 4 and Arts Councill England to create new work, whilst retaining a DIY, kinetic and radical spirit on the screen. Britpop and Cool Brittania may have dominated the media mainstream, but this rich seam of underground filmmaking and basement screenings offered a snapshot of real life from across London.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis special opening screening of LSFF brings together rarely-seen early films from filmmakers including Peter Strickland, Carol Morley, Andrea Luka Zimmerman and Alnoor Dewshi. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe filmmakers will join us after the screening for an extended Q&A.\r\n\r\n\r\nLatifah and Himli's Nomadic Uncle (Alnoor Dewshi, 1992, 17 mins)\r\nI'm Not Here (Carol Morley, 1994, 15 min)\r\nThe Hackney Downs (Jamie Thraves, 1995, 13 mins)\r\nThe Insect House (Seonaid MacKay, 3 mins, 1995)\r\nHorseplay (Alison Murray, 5 mins, 1995)\r\nBubblegum (Peter Strickland, 15 mins, 1996)\r\nRaj or Radge?

Surveillance drones fill the burnt orange skies and militarised police roam the wrecked streets, while humans hide away underground, struggling to remember a free and hopeful existence. In this ingenious mixture of visionary science fiction and nonfiction, Oscar-winning director, Asif Kapadia (SENNA, AMY) transports us to a future foreshadowed by the terrifying realities of our present. Samantha Morton (MINORITY REPORT) plays a survivor besieged by nightmare visions of the past—a past that happens to be our present, visualised through contemporary footage interconnecting today’s global crises of authoritarianism, unchecked big tech, inequality, and our global climate crisis.\r\n\r\n2073 is an urgent, unshakable vision of a dystopic future that could very well be our own.\r\n",

These films are deep dives into the psychologies—human and non-human—that encapsulate the zeitgeist of our era. And behind the whimsical stories, there are sighs of resignation and footprints of the Imp of the Perverse.\r\n\r\nA parody western musical, a teenage girl’s damp daydream, a middle-age woman’s imaginative escape from the monotony of married life, a grand tour around the wasteland of computer graphics where memories are as malleable as distorted skin texture. No matter ifit’s two dogs’ existential awakening, a spider’s witness of an apocalypse, or two friends’ bougie self-care weekend trip to a sterling-haunted forest, reveries bleed into the screen and image becomes a delicate reality. \r\n\r\nAtom and Void, dir.

As we are marching towards the fourth decade of the 21st century, new technology has only become more scary than exciting, more uncanny than friendly. Films in this program reflect such anxiety of ours, and beg the question—as they move between documentary and speculative fiction: Is this a future we want?\r\n\r\nThere are many films in the program that blend experimental elements of AI with conventional filmmaking. A docu-fiction of rediscovered Bangladroids who recall, in poetry, their past lives. A farce about a man obsessed with a broken bench underpinned by a rock. From a brief history of 20th century technological advance, to a crash course on AI literacy and how to safeguard our genuine reality, then to the invasion of social media that has fundamentally reconfigured the coming-of-age years of teenagers, you are here for unhinged images, unsettling stories, and visualisation of outlandish worlds where technology seems to be demanding its own autonomy — if not its control over us humans.\r\n\r\nWe Made Telephones, dir.

Interspersed throughout are interviews with prominent journalists, Israeli statesmen, Netanyahu's associates, and longtime friends, whose observations and anecdotes reveal a chilling portrait of a leader who, in his drive to evade justice, has aligned himself with radical right-wing extremists. Netanyahu’s fixation on his entitlement to remain Prime Minister has, in this way, led to political decisions that have endangered Israel’s safety, and destroyed her standing as a democracy in the Middle East.\r\n",

THE BIBI FILES is a film about a man singularly focused on his own political survival in a region beset by war.\r\n\r\nLeaked footage from police interrogation videos are interwoven with archival footage that shows Netanyahu’s rise to power, and how his nearly 30-year rule as Prime Minister has divided the state of Israel. Interspersed throughout are interviews with prominent journalists, Israeli statesmen, Netanyahu's associates, and longtime friends, whose observations and anecdotes reveal a chilling portrait of a leader who, in his drive to evade justice, has aligned himself with radical right-wing extremists. Netanyahu’s fixation on his entitlement to remain Prime Minister has, in this way, led to political decisions that have endangered Israel’s safety, and destroyed her standing as a democracy in the Middle East.\r\n",

Using camcorders, letters, and analogue memories, these films compose fractions of stories set in rural geographies and trace immigration heritage. From folkloric rumours of gigantic cats, whimsical Elvis impersonation and digital re-examinations of systemic segregation, these films speak from the heart of British identity - collecting stories from all over the nation to paint a cross-cultural, contemporary portrait.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe’ve combined odes to eccentric British humour such as Piece of Cake, and My Dad and the Volcano, traverse the day-to-day of immigrant heritage in Journey Mercies and Dear F... discovering intimate, nostalgic records of regional history. Above all, this programme seeks to celebrate British cultural self-consciousness through the medium of filmmaking.\r\n\r\nHave You Seen the Beast?, dir.

These microscopic particles drift in the air, float in all bodies of water, and mix into the soil, becoming a permanent part of the environment.\r\n\r\nNow, scientists are finding these particles in our bodies. What is the impact of these invisible invaders on our health? And can anything be done about it?\r\n\r\nAcclaimed author and science journalist Ziya Tong takes a personal approach by visiting leading scientists around the world and undergoing experiments in her home, on her food, and her body. This is an eye-opening wake-up call for all of us to rethink our relationship with plastic.",

Surveillance drones fill the burnt orange skies and militarised police roam the wrecked streets, while humans hide away underground, struggling to remember a free and hopeful existence. In this ingenious mixture of visionary science fiction and nonfiction, Oscar-winning director, Asif Kapadia (SENNA, AMY) transports us to a future foreshadowed by the terrifying realities of our present. Samantha Morton (MINORITY REPORT) plays a survivor besieged by nightmare visions of the past—a past that happens to be our present, visualised through contemporary footage interconnecting today’s global crises of authoritarianism, unchecked big tech, inequality, and our global climate crisis.\r\n\r\n2073 is an urgent, unshakable vision of a dystopic future that could very well be our own.\r\n",
