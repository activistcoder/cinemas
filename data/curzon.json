Winner of the Best Actor award at Cannes 2023, Koji Yakusho (Babel, 13 Assassins) stars as Hirayama, a contemplative middle-aged man who lives a life of modesty and serenity, spending his days balancing his job as a dutiful caretaker of Tokyo’s numerous public toilets with his passion for music, literature and photography. As we join him on his structured daily routine, a series of unexpected encounters gradually begin to reveal a hidden past that lies behind his otherwise content and harmonious life. \n\nCombining a refreshingly unstereotypical depiction of the Japanese capital with a soundtrack comprised of iconic hits from the 60s and 80s, this is a subtle, shimmering and ultimately life-affirming reflection on finding beauty in the everyday world around us. Japan’s entry for Best International Film at the 2024 Academy Awards.\n",

To prove his point, Monk uses a pen name to write an outlandish “Black” book of his own, a book that propels him to the heart of hypocrisy and the madness he claims to disdain.",

Winner of the Best Actor award at Cannes 2023, Koji Yakusho (Babel, 13 Assassins) stars as Hirayama, a contemplative middle-aged man who lives a life of modesty and serenity, spending his days balancing his job as a dutiful caretaker of Tokyo’s numerous public toilets with his passion for music, literature and photography. As we join him on his structured daily routine, a series of unexpected encounters gradually begin to reveal a hidden past that lies behind his otherwise content and harmonious life. \n\nCombining a refreshingly unstereotypical depiction of the Japanese capital with a soundtrack comprised of iconic hits from the 60s and 80s, this is a subtle, shimmering and ultimately life-affirming reflection on finding beauty in the everyday world around us. Japan’s entry for Best International Film at the 2024 Academy Awards.\n",

Based on a stranger than fiction true story, WICKED LITTLE LETTERS follows two neighbours: deeply conservative local Edith Swan (Olivia Colman) and rowdy Irish migrant Rose Gooding (Jessie Buckley). When Edith and fellow residents begin to receive wicked letters full of unintentionally hilarious profanities, foulmouthed Rose is charged with the crime. The anonymous letters prompt a national uproar, and a trial ensues. However, as the town's women - led by Police Officer Gladys Moss (Anjana Vasan) - begin to investigate the crime themselves, they suspect that something is amiss, and Rose may not be the culprit after all.",

Winner of the Best Actor award at Cannes 2023, Koji Yakusho (Babel, 13 Assassins) stars as Hirayama, a contemplative middle-aged man who lives a life of modesty and serenity, spending his days balancing his job as a dutiful caretaker of Tokyo’s numerous public toilets with his passion for music, literature and photography. As we join him on his structured daily routine, a series of unexpected encounters gradually begin to reveal a hidden past that lies behind his otherwise content and harmonious life. \n\nCombining a refreshingly unstereotypical depiction of the Japanese capital with a soundtrack comprised of iconic hits from the 60s and 80s, this is a subtle, shimmering and ultimately life-affirming reflection on finding beauty in the everyday world around us. Japan’s entry for Best International Film at the 2024 Academy Awards.\n",

As he recalls the progress of the movement, he reunites with friends and former activists, together questioning what has been achieved, twenty years on.\r\n\r\nThis new 4K restoration of I Heard It Through The Grapevine brings James Baldwin back to the screen in his centenary year. While co-directors Dick Fontaine, who passed away in October 2023, and Pat Hartley deftly interweave archive footage, they never stray far from the guiding intellect of Baldwin. The result is an intimate and emotionally charged journey, raising questions that resonate ever louder through the passing decades.\r\n\r\nRestored by Harvard Film Archive.

Based on a stranger than fiction true story, WICKED LITTLE LETTERS follows two neighbours: deeply conservative local Edith Swan (Olivia Colman) and rowdy Irish migrant Rose Gooding (Jessie Buckley). When Edith and fellow residents begin to receive wicked letters full of unintentionally hilarious profanities, foulmouthed Rose is charged with the crime. The anonymous letters prompt a national uproar, and a trial ensues. However, as the town's women - led by Police Officer Gladys Moss (Anjana Vasan) - begin to investigate the crime themselves, they suspect that something is amiss, and Rose may not be the culprit after all.",

Winner of the Best Actor award at Cannes 2023, Koji Yakusho (Babel, 13 Assassins) stars as Hirayama, a contemplative middle-aged man who lives a life of modesty and serenity, spending his days balancing his job as a dutiful caretaker of Tokyo’s numerous public toilets with his passion for music, literature and photography. As we join him on his structured daily routine, a series of unexpected encounters gradually begin to reveal a hidden past that lies behind his otherwise content and harmonious life. \n\nCombining a refreshingly unstereotypical depiction of the Japanese capital with a soundtrack comprised of iconic hits from the 60s and 80s, this is a subtle, shimmering and ultimately life-affirming reflection on finding beauty in the everyday world around us. Japan’s entry for Best International Film at the 2024 Academy Awards.\n",

Part of the Official Selection of the 2023 Cannes Film Festival, Oscar-nominated Robot Dreams is the first animated film from Pablo Berger (Blancanieves).\n\nDog is lonely. He spends a lot of time by himself, whiling away long evenings in his Manhattan studio apartment, eating microwave meals for one in front of the TV. Tired of his solitary existence, he decides to purchase a friend. When his order arrives, he builds Robot, a fun-loving, happy-go-lucky companion to keep him company. Dog and Robot spend an idyllic day together – frolicking through the city to the joyful melody of Earth, Wind & Fire’s ‘September’ – ending up at Coney Island to enjoy the fun. But they are soon separated on the beach. Dog, devastated at the loss of his friend, does everything in his power to get Robot back.  \n\nSet in the 1980s, vivified by a poppy soundtrack and a strong affinity for cinema history, Robot Dreams is a deeply felt, bittersweet buddy comedy that embraces ambiguity and the uncertainty of life’s path.\n",

As he recalls the progress of the movement, he reunites with friends and former activists, together questioning what has been achieved, twenty years on.\r\n\r\nThis new 4K restoration of I Heard It Through The Grapevine brings James Baldwin back to the screen in his centenary year. While co-directors Dick Fontaine, who passed away in October 2023, and Pat Hartley deftly interweave archive footage, they never stray far from the guiding intellect of Baldwin. The result is an intimate and emotionally charged journey, raising questions that resonate ever louder through the passing decades.\r\n\r\nRestored by Harvard Film Archive.

Director Kevin Macdonald investigates the multiple facets and contradictions of John Galliano’s character, and the decades of industry pressure and drug and alcohol addiction that surrounded his downfall.\r\n\r\nFeaturing conversations with Naomi Campbell, Kate Moss, Penelope Cruz, Charlize Theron, Anna Wintour, Edward Enninful, Boris Cyrulnik, Hamish Bowles and Sidney Toledano, among others, High & Low: John Galliano explores culpability, cancellation and questions who society 'cancels' and who gets granted a second chance.",

Part of the Official Selection of the 2023 Cannes Film Festival, Oscar-nominated Robot Dreams is the first animated film from Pablo Berger (Blancanieves).\n\nDog is lonely. He spends a lot of time by himself, whiling away long evenings in his Manhattan studio apartment, eating microwave meals for one in front of the TV. Tired of his solitary existence, he decides to purchase a friend. When his order arrives, he builds Robot, a fun-loving, happy-go-lucky companion to keep him company. Dog and Robot spend an idyllic day together – frolicking through the city to the joyful melody of Earth, Wind & Fire’s ‘September’ – ending up at Coney Island to enjoy the fun. But they are soon separated on the beach. Dog, devastated at the loss of his friend, does everything in his power to get Robot back.  \n\nSet in the 1980s, vivified by a poppy soundtrack and a strong affinity for cinema history, Robot Dreams is a deeply felt, bittersweet buddy comedy that embraces ambiguity and the uncertainty of life’s path.\n",

Based on a stranger than fiction true story, WICKED LITTLE LETTERS follows two neighbours: deeply conservative local Edith Swan (Olivia Colman) and rowdy Irish migrant Rose Gooding (Jessie Buckley). When Edith and fellow residents begin to receive wicked letters full of unintentionally hilarious profanities, foulmouthed Rose is charged with the crime. The anonymous letters prompt a national uproar, and a trial ensues. However, as the town's women - led by Police Officer Gladys Moss (Anjana Vasan) - begin to investigate the crime themselves, they suspect that something is amiss, and Rose may not be the culprit after all.",

Winner of the Best Actor award at Cannes 2023, Koji Yakusho (Babel, 13 Assassins) stars as Hirayama, a contemplative middle-aged man who lives a life of modesty and serenity, spending his days balancing his job as a dutiful caretaker of Tokyo’s numerous public toilets with his passion for music, literature and photography. As we join him on his structured daily routine, a series of unexpected encounters gradually begin to reveal a hidden past that lies behind his otherwise content and harmonious life. \n\nCombining a refreshingly unstereotypical depiction of the Japanese capital with a soundtrack comprised of iconic hits from the 60s and 80s, this is a subtle, shimmering and ultimately life-affirming reflection on finding beauty in the everyday world around us. Japan’s entry for Best International Film at the 2024 Academy Awards.\n",

Press, TV and thousands of fans flock to the Azteca Stadium for a tense and glorious tournament - the Copa 71.\r\n\r\nDismissed by both FIFA and domestic football associations around the world, this event has been written out of sporting history.\r\n\r\nTold by the pioneering players who participated in Mexico, and filled with tremendous archive footage unseen for fifty years, Copa 71 is a lively retelling of the highs and lows of this groundbreaking championship.",

Director Kate Stonehill has crafted a razor-sharp analysis that unveils unsettling questions about the rule of law, modern espionage and digital privacy.",

Based on a stranger than fiction true story, WICKED LITTLE LETTERS follows two neighbours: deeply conservative local Edith Swan (Olivia Colman) and rowdy Irish migrant Rose Gooding (Jessie Buckley). When Edith and fellow residents begin to receive wicked letters full of unintentionally hilarious profanities, foulmouthed Rose is charged with the crime. The anonymous letters prompt a national uproar, and a trial ensues. However, as the town's women - led by Police Officer Gladys Moss (Anjana Vasan) - begin to investigate the crime themselves, they suspect that something is amiss, and Rose may not be the culprit after all.",

Winner of the Best Actor award at Cannes 2023, Koji Yakusho (Babel, 13 Assassins) stars as Hirayama, a contemplative middle-aged man who lives a life of modesty and serenity, spending his days balancing his job as a dutiful caretaker of Tokyo’s numerous public toilets with his passion for music, literature and photography. As we join him on his structured daily routine, a series of unexpected encounters gradually begin to reveal a hidden past that lies behind his otherwise content and harmonious life. \n\nCombining a refreshingly unstereotypical depiction of the Japanese capital with a soundtrack comprised of iconic hits from the 60s and 80s, this is a subtle, shimmering and ultimately life-affirming reflection on finding beauty in the everyday world around us. Japan’s entry for Best International Film at the 2024 Academy Awards.\n",

Part of the Official Selection of the 2023 Cannes Film Festival, Oscar-nominated Robot Dreams is the first animated film from Pablo Berger (Blancanieves).\n\nDog is lonely. He spends a lot of time by himself, whiling away long evenings in his Manhattan studio apartment, eating microwave meals for one in front of the TV. Tired of his solitary existence, he decides to purchase a friend. When his order arrives, he builds Robot, a fun-loving, happy-go-lucky companion to keep him company. Dog and Robot spend an idyllic day together – frolicking through the city to the joyful melody of Earth, Wind & Fire’s ‘September’ – ending up at Coney Island to enjoy the fun. But they are soon separated on the beach. Dog, devastated at the loss of his friend, does everything in his power to get Robot back.  \n\nSet in the 1980s, vivified by a poppy soundtrack and a strong affinity for cinema history, Robot Dreams is a deeply felt, bittersweet buddy comedy that embraces ambiguity and the uncertainty of life’s path.\n",

Jeffrey Wright stars as Monk, a frustrated novelist who’s fed up with the establishment profiting from “Black” entertainment that relies on tired and offensive tropes. To prove his point, Monk uses a pen name to write an outlandish “Black” book of his own, a book that propels him to the heart of hypocrisy and the madness he claims to disdain.",

Based on a stranger than fiction true story, WICKED LITTLE LETTERS follows two neighbours: deeply conservative local Edith Swan (Olivia Colman) and rowdy Irish migrant Rose Gooding (Jessie Buckley). When Edith and fellow residents begin to receive wicked letters full of unintentionally hilarious profanities, foulmouthed Rose is charged with the crime. The anonymous letters prompt a national uproar, and a trial ensues. However, as the town's women - led by Police Officer Gladys Moss (Anjana Vasan) - begin to investigate the crime themselves, they suspect that something is amiss, and Rose may not be the culprit after all.",

Winner of the Best Actor award at Cannes 2023, Koji Yakusho (Babel, 13 Assassins) stars as Hirayama, a contemplative middle-aged man who lives a life of modesty and serenity, spending his days balancing his job as a dutiful caretaker of Tokyo’s numerous public toilets with his passion for music, literature and photography. As we join him on his structured daily routine, a series of unexpected encounters gradually begin to reveal a hidden past that lies behind his otherwise content and harmonious life. \n\nCombining a refreshingly unstereotypical depiction of the Japanese capital with a soundtrack comprised of iconic hits from the 60s and 80s, this is a subtle, shimmering and ultimately life-affirming reflection on finding beauty in the everyday world around us. Japan’s entry for Best International Film at the 2024 Academy Awards.\n",

Galliano was widely recognized as one of the most successful names in 1990s and 2000s couture, until his career abruptly ended when he was caught on camera in 2011 hurling antisemitic and racist insults at bystanders in Paris. Macdonald’s compelling documentary traces Galliano’s working and private life through the decades, candidly investigating his struggles with addiction and the industry pressure he faced along the way. Featuring conversations with Naomi Campbell, Kate Moss, Penelope Cruz, Charlize Theron, Anna Wintour, Edward Enninful and more.",

As he recalls the progress of the movement, he reunites with friends and former activists, together questioning what has been achieved, twenty years on.\r\n\r\nThis new 4K restoration of I Heard It Through The Grapevine brings James Baldwin back to the screen in his centenary year. While co-directors Dick Fontaine, who passed away in October 2023, and Pat Hartley deftly interweave archive footage, they never stray far from the guiding intellect of Baldwin. The result is an intimate and emotionally charged journey, raising questions that resonate ever louder through the passing decades.\r\n\r\nRestored by Harvard Film Archive. Special thanks to Gugulethu Mseleku, Smokey Fontaine, the late Dick Fontaine, and Pat Hartley.",

Jeffrey Wright stars as Monk, a frustrated novelist who’s fed up with the establishment profiting from “Black” entertainment that relies on tired and offensive tropes. To prove his point, Monk uses a pen name to write an outlandish “Black” book of his own, a book that propels him to the heart of hypocrisy and the madness he claims to disdain.",

Based on a stranger than fiction true story, WICKED LITTLE LETTERS follows two neighbours: deeply conservative local Edith Swan (Olivia Colman) and rowdy Irish migrant Rose Gooding (Jessie Buckley). When Edith and fellow residents begin to receive wicked letters full of unintentionally hilarious profanities, foulmouthed Rose is charged with the crime. The anonymous letters prompt a national uproar, and a trial ensues. However, as the town's women - led by Police Officer Gladys Moss (Anjana Vasan) - begin to investigate the crime themselves, they suspect that something is amiss, and Rose may not be the culprit after all.",

As we join him on his structured daily routine, a series of unexpected encounters gradually begin to reveal a hidden past that lies behind his otherwise content and harmonious life. \n\nCombining a refreshingly unstereotypical depiction of the Japanese capital with a soundtrack comprised of iconic hits from the 60s and 80s, this is a subtle, shimmering and ultimately life-affirming reflection on finding beauty in the everyday world around us. Japan’s entry for Best International Film at the 2024 Academy Awards.\n",

Director Kate Stonehill has crafted a razor-sharp analysis that unveils unsettling questions about the rule of law, modern espionage and digital privacy.",
