When Edith and fellow residents begin to receive wicked letters full of unintentionally hilarious profanities, foulmouthed Rose is charged with the crime. The anonymous letters prompt a national uproar, and a trial ensues. However, as the town's women - led by Police Officer Gladys Moss (Anjana Vasan) - begin to investigate the crime themselves, they suspect that something is amiss, and Rose may not be the culprit after all.",

Winner of the Best Actor award at Cannes 2023, Koji Yakusho (Babel, 13 Assassins) stars as Hirayama, a contemplative middle-aged man who lives a life of modesty and serenity, spending his days balancing his job as a dutiful caretaker of Tokyo’s numerous public toilets with his passion for music, literature and photography. As we join him on his structured daily routine, a series of unexpected encounters gradually begin to reveal a hidden past that lies behind his otherwise content and harmonious life. \n\nCombining a refreshingly unstereotypical depiction of the Japanese capital with a soundtrack comprised of iconic hits from the 60s and 80s, this is a subtle, shimmering and ultimately life-affirming reflection on finding beauty in the everyday world around us. Japan’s entry for Best International Film at the 2024 Academy Awards.\n",

Winner of the Best Actor award at Cannes 2023, Koji Yakusho (Babel, 13 Assassins) stars as Hirayama, a contemplative middle-aged man who lives a life of modesty and serenity, spending his days balancing his job as a dutiful caretaker of Tokyo’s numerous public toilets with his passion for music, literature and photography. As we join him on his structured daily routine, a series of unexpected encounters gradually begin to reveal a hidden past that lies behind his otherwise content and harmonious life. \n\nCombining a refreshingly unstereotypical depiction of the Japanese capital with a soundtrack comprised of iconic hits from the 60s and 80s, this is a subtle, shimmering and ultimately life-affirming reflection on finding beauty in the everyday world around us. Japan’s entry for Best International Film at the 2024 Academy Awards.\n",

Each new passenger, whether they’re women or men, young or old, individuals or families, has first-hand experience of the Russian invasion, and a spectrum of emotions surfaces in the car transporting them to safety. Children quietly read books, a woman weeps for the cow she’s left behind, others are lost for words… Amidst this tragedy, the chaos of conflict and upended lives, there are fleeting moments of humour and hope. And beyond the confines of the minibus, we witness the expanse of rural Ukraine – a vast landscape of natural beauty littered with the carnage of war, and the desolation and destruction of once populated communities.",

When Edith and fellow residents begin to receive wicked letters full of unintentionally hilarious profanities, foulmouthed Rose is charged with the crime.

However, as the town's women - led by Police Officer Gladys Moss (Anjana Vasan) - begin to investigate the crime themselves, they suspect that something is amiss, and Rose may not be the culprit after all.",

Winner of the Best Actor award at Cannes 2023, Koji Yakusho (Babel, 13 Assassins) stars as Hirayama, a contemplative middle-aged man who lives a life of modesty and serenity, spending his days balancing his job as a dutiful caretaker of Tokyo’s numerous public toilets with his passion for music, literature and photography. As we join him on his structured daily routine, a series of unexpected encounters gradually begin to reveal a hidden past that lies behind his otherwise content and harmonious life. \n\nCombining a refreshingly unstereotypical depiction of the Japanese capital with a soundtrack comprised of iconic hits from the 60s and 80s, this is a subtle, shimmering and ultimately life-affirming reflection on finding beauty in the everyday world around us. Japan’s entry for Best International Film at the 2024 Academy Awards.\n",

An imaginative band of dreamers, their hopes for their futures are tempered by the limits of the world the around them, and the sound of gunfire is never far away.\r\n\r\nInto this picture comes an extraordinary opportunity: an expedition to the Himalayas that will provide a brief escape from the reality of war, and open up untold new horizons.\r\n\r\nUkrainian director Alisa Kovalenko's perceptive gaze gently captures a coming-of-age tale like no other, and a generation that, in spite of everything, is able to recognise and celebrate the fragile beauty of life.",

The British architects Alison & Peter Smithson failed with their grand, utopian vision for better living, but what is really behind the ostracized facade?\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the participation of residents, experts and critics, and collaborations with Harvard University, the V&A and the Venice Biennale, Robin Hood Gardens paints a polychromatic portrait of this building complex, reappraising the intentions behind it and the backlash against it, in search of answers about the failing of modernism.",

When Edith and fellow residents begin to receive wicked letters full of unintentionally hilarious profanities, foulmouthed Rose is charged with the crime. The anonymous letters prompt a national uproar, and a trial ensues. However, as the town's women - led by Police Officer Gladys Moss (Anjana Vasan) - begin to investigate the crime themselves, they suspect that something is amiss, and Rose may not be the culprit after all.",

Jeffrey Wright stars as Monk, a frustrated novelist who’s fed up with the establishment profiting from “Black” entertainment that relies on tired and offensive tropes. To prove his point, Monk uses a pen name to write an outlandish “Black” book of his own, a book that propels him to the heart of hypocrisy and the madness he claims to disdain.",

Winner of the Best Actor award at Cannes 2023, Koji Yakusho (Babel, 13 Assassins) stars as Hirayama, a contemplative middle-aged man who lives a life of modesty and serenity, spending his days balancing his job as a dutiful caretaker of Tokyo’s numerous public toilets with his passion for music, literature and photography. As we join him on his structured daily routine, a series of unexpected encounters gradually begin to reveal a hidden past that lies behind his otherwise content and harmonious life. \n\nCombining a refreshingly unstereotypical depiction of the Japanese capital with a soundtrack comprised of iconic hits from the 60s and 80s, this is a subtle, shimmering and ultimately life-affirming reflection on finding beauty in the everyday world around us. Japan’s entry for Best International Film at the 2024 Academy Awards.\n",

      "synopsis": "Can you be a perpetrator and a victim at the same time? A harrowing question of diminished responsibility is complicated by the horrors of Uganda's post-civil war atrocities.\r\n\r\nThe International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague is charging Dominic Ongwen with 70 different counts of crimes committed whilst in a commanding role in rebel leader Joseph Kony's Lord's Resistance Army (LRA). Ongwen's defence lawyer, Krispus Ayena, is preparing to argue that his client was abducted at the age of 9 and brainwashed by Kony, who used a combination of Christianity, witchcraft and torture to turn thousands of children into LRA killing machines, in his rebellion against Ugandan president Yoweri Museveni.\r\n\r\n\r\nGrappling with a deeply complex moral conundrum of guilt and punishment, against the backdrop of Uganda's 'theatre of violence', this unprecedented film encourages viewers to confront difficult questions about the various meanings of 'justice'.",

Based on a stranger than fiction true story, WICKED LITTLE LETTERS follows two neighbours: deeply conservative local Edith Swan (Olivia Colman) and rowdy Irish migrant Rose Gooding (Jessie Buckley). When Edith and fellow residents begin to receive wicked letters full of unintentionally hilarious profanities, foulmouthed Rose is charged with the crime. The anonymous letters prompt a national uproar, and a trial ensues. However, as the town's women - led by Police Officer Gladys Moss (Anjana Vasan) - begin to investigate the crime themselves, they suspect that something is amiss, and Rose may not be the culprit after all.",

Winner of the Best Actor award at Cannes 2023, Koji Yakusho (Babel, 13 Assassins) stars as Hirayama, a contemplative middle-aged man who lives a life of modesty and serenity, spending his days balancing his job as a dutiful caretaker of Tokyo’s numerous public toilets with his passion for music, literature and photography. As we join him on his structured daily routine, a series of unexpected encounters gradually begin to reveal a hidden past that lies behind his otherwise content and harmonious life. \n\nCombining a refreshingly unstereotypical depiction of the Japanese capital with a soundtrack comprised of iconic hits from the 60s and 80s, this is a subtle, shimmering and ultimately life-affirming reflection on finding beauty in the everyday world around us. Japan’s entry for Best International Film at the 2024 Academy Awards.\n",

Ongwen's defence lawyer, Krispus Ayena, is preparing to argue that his client was abducted at the age of 9 and brainwashed by Kony, who used a combination of Christianity, witchcraft and torture to turn thousands of children into LRA killing machines, in his rebellion against Ugandan president Yoweri Museveni.\r\n\r\n\r\nGrappling with a deeply complex moral conundrum of guilt and punishment, against the backdrop of Uganda's 'theatre of violence', this unprecedented film encourages viewers to confront difficult questions about the various meanings of 'justice'.",

While the younger two are present to re-enact scenes from their family history, the disappearance of the older two from the family home becomes the central burning question around which the narrative spirals.\r\n\r\nThe two missing sisters will be played by professional actors in staged reconstructions, guided by Olfa and her younger girls, and multi-award-winning Tunisian-Egyptian actor Hend Sabri steps into Olfa's shoes, and into the narrative.\r\n\r\nAs bonds form between the family members and the actors, director Kaouther Ben Hania sets up an extraordinary film mechanism to unveil the story of Olfa and her family.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn intimate journey full of hope, rebellion, violence, intergenerational transmission and sisterhood, which will question the very foundation of our societies.

An imaginative band of dreamers, their hopes for their futures are tempered by the limits of the world the around them, and the sound of gunfire is never far away.\r\n\r\nInto this picture comes an extraordinary opportunity: an expedition to the Himalayas that will provide a brief escape from the reality of war, and open up untold new horizons.\r\n\r\nUkrainian director Alisa Kovalenko's perceptive gaze gently captures a coming-of-age tale like no other, and a generation that, in spite of everything, is able to recognise and celebrate the fragile beauty of life.",

To prove his point, Monk uses a pen name to write an outlandish “Black” book of his own, a book that propels him to the heart of hypocrisy and the madness he claims to disdain.",

      "synopsis": "A 1920s English seaside town bears witness to a dark and absurd scandal in this riotous mystery comedy. Based on a stranger than fiction true story, WICKED LITTLE LETTERS follows two neighbours: deeply conservative local Edith Swan (Olivia Colman) and rowdy Irish migrant Rose Gooding (Jessie Buckley). When Edith and fellow residents begin to receive wicked letters full of unintentionally hilarious profanities, foulmouthed Rose is charged with the crime. The anonymous letters prompt a national uproar, and a trial ensues. However, as the town's women - led by Police Officer Gladys Moss (Anjana Vasan) - begin to investigate the crime themselves, they suspect that something is amiss, and Rose may not be the culprit after all.",

Winner of the Best Actor award at Cannes 2023, Koji Yakusho (Babel, 13 Assassins) stars as Hirayama, a contemplative middle-aged man who lives a life of modesty and serenity, spending his days balancing his job as a dutiful caretaker of Tokyo’s numerous public toilets with his passion for music, literature and photography. As we join him on his structured daily routine, a series of unexpected encounters gradually begin to reveal a hidden past that lies behind his otherwise content and harmonious life. \n\nCombining a refreshingly unstereotypical depiction of the Japanese capital with a soundtrack comprised of iconic hits from the 60s and 80s, this is a subtle, shimmering and ultimately life-affirming reflection on finding beauty in the everyday world around us. Japan’s entry for Best International Film at the 2024 Academy Awards.\n",

One shows the city’s devastating Nazi occupation through door-to-door accounts – tales of Jewish persecution, of resistance, collaboration, valour, and denial. The other is a vivid journey through the last years of pandemic and protest. The combination has a transformative effect with which McQueen opens up a poetic, dreamlike space where unthinkable history and hope for a new future co-exist.",

A harrowing question of diminished responsibility is complicated by the horrors of Uganda's post-civil war atrocities.\r\n\r\nThe International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague is charging Dominic Ongwen with 70 different counts of crimes committed whilst in a commanding role in rebel leader Joseph Kony's Lord's Resistance Army (LRA). Ongwen's defence lawyer, Krispus Ayena, is preparing to argue that his client was abducted at the age of 9 and brainwashed by Kony, who used a combination of Christianity, witchcraft and torture to turn thousands of children into LRA killing machines, in his rebellion against Ugandan president Yoweri Museveni.\r\n\r\n\r\nGrappling with a deeply complex moral conundrum of guilt and punishment, against the backdrop of Uganda's 'theatre of violence', this unprecedented film encourages viewers to confront difficult questions about the various meanings of 'justice'.",

While the younger two are present to re-enact scenes from their family history, the disappearance of the older two from the family home becomes the central burning question around which the narrative spirals.\r\n\r\nThe two missing sisters will be played by professional actors in staged reconstructions, guided by Olfa and her younger girls, and multi-award-winning Tunisian-Egyptian actor Hend Sabri steps into Olfa's shoes, and into the narrative.\r\n\r\nAs bonds form between the family members and the actors, director Kaouther Ben Hania sets up an extraordinary film mechanism to unveil the story of Olfa and her family.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn intimate journey full of hope, rebellion, violence, intergenerational transmission and sisterhood, which will question the very foundation of our societies.

Based on a stranger than fiction true story, WICKED LITTLE LETTERS follows two neighbours: deeply conservative local Edith Swan (Olivia Colman) and rowdy Irish migrant Rose Gooding (Jessie Buckley). When Edith and fellow residents begin to receive wicked letters full of unintentionally hilarious profanities, foulmouthed Rose is charged with the crime. The anonymous letters prompt a national uproar, and a trial ensues. However, as the town's women - led by Police Officer Gladys Moss (Anjana Vasan) - begin to investigate the crime themselves, they suspect that something is amiss, and Rose may not be the culprit after all.",

      "synopsis": "AMERICAN FICTION is Cord Jefferson's hilarious directorial debut, which confronts our culture’s obsession with reducing people to outrageous stereotypes. Jeffrey Wright stars as Monk, a frustrated novelist who’s fed up with the establishment profiting from “Black” entertainment that relies on tired and offensive tropes. To prove his point, Monk uses a pen name to write an outlandish “Black” book of his own, a book that propels him to the heart of hypocrisy and the madness he claims to disdain.",

Winner of the Best Actor award at Cannes 2023, Koji Yakusho (Babel, 13 Assassins) stars as Hirayama, a contemplative middle-aged man who lives a life of modesty and serenity, spending his days balancing his job as a dutiful caretaker of Tokyo’s numerous public toilets with his passion for music, literature and photography. As we join him on his structured daily routine, a series of unexpected encounters gradually begin to reveal a hidden past that lies behind his otherwise content and harmonious life. \n\nCombining a refreshingly unstereotypical depiction of the Japanese capital with a soundtrack comprised of iconic hits from the 60s and 80s, this is a subtle, shimmering and ultimately life-affirming reflection on finding beauty in the everyday world around us. Japan’s entry for Best International Film at the 2024 Academy Awards.\n",

Ongwen's defence lawyer, Krispus Ayena, is preparing to argue that his client was abducted at the age of 9 and brainwashed by Kony, who used a combination of Christianity, witchcraft and torture to turn thousands of children into LRA killing machines, in his rebellion against Ugandan president Yoweri Museveni.\r\n\r\n\r\nGrappling with a deeply complex moral conundrum of guilt and punishment, against the backdrop of Uganda's 'theatre of violence', this unprecedented film encourages viewers to confront difficult questions about the various meanings of 'justice'.",

While the younger two are present to re-enact scenes from their family history, the disappearance of the older two from the family home becomes the central burning question around which the narrative spirals.\r\n\r\nThe two missing sisters will be played by professional actors in staged reconstructions, guided by Olfa and her younger girls, and multi-award-winning Tunisian-Egyptian actor Hend Sabri steps into Olfa's shoes, and into the narrative.\r\n\r\nAs bonds form between the family members and the actors, director Kaouther Ben Hania sets up an extraordinary film mechanism to unveil the story of Olfa and her family.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn intimate journey full of hope, rebellion, violence, intergenerational transmission and sisterhood, which will question the very foundation of our societies.

An imaginative band of dreamers, their hopes for their futures are tempered by the limits of the world the around them, and the sound of gunfire is never far away.\r\n\r\nInto this picture comes an extraordinary opportunity: an expedition to the Himalayas that will provide a brief escape from the reality of war, and open up untold new horizons.\r\n\r\nUkrainian director Alisa Kovalenko's perceptive gaze gently captures a coming-of-age tale like no other, and a generation that, in spite of everything, is able to recognise and celebrate the fragile beauty of life.",

When Edith and fellow residents begin to receive wicked letters full of unintentionally hilarious profanities, foulmouthed Rose is charged with the crime. The anonymous letters prompt a national uproar, and a trial ensues. However, as the town's women - led by Police Officer Gladys Moss (Anjana Vasan) - begin to investigate the crime themselves, they suspect that something is amiss, and Rose may not be the culprit after all.",

Winner of the Best Actor award at Cannes 2023, Koji Yakusho (Babel, 13 Assassins) stars as Hirayama, a contemplative middle-aged man who lives a life of modesty and serenity, spending his days balancing his job as a dutiful caretaker of Tokyo’s numerous public toilets with his passion for music, literature and photography. As we join him on his structured daily routine, a series of unexpected encounters gradually begin to reveal a hidden past that lies behind his otherwise content and harmonious life. \n\nCombining a refreshingly unstereotypical depiction of the Japanese capital with a soundtrack comprised of iconic hits from the 60s and 80s, this is a subtle, shimmering and ultimately life-affirming reflection on finding beauty in the everyday world around us. Japan’s entry for Best International Film at the 2024 Academy Awards.\n",

      "synopsis": "Formally inventive and strikingly astute, this Oscar-nominated hybrid explores the life of Tunisian mother Olfa and her four daughters. While the younger two are present to re-enact scenes from their family history, the disappearance of the older two from the family home becomes the central burning question around which the narrative spirals.\r\n\r\nThe two missing sisters will be played by professional actors in staged reconstructions, guided by Olfa and her younger girls, and multi-award-winning Tunisian-Egyptian actor Hend Sabri steps into Olfa's shoes, and into the narrative.\r\n\r\nAs bonds form between the family members and the actors, director Kaouther Ben Hania sets up an extraordinary film mechanism to unveil the story of Olfa and her family.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn intimate journey full of hope, rebellion, violence, intergenerational transmission and sisterhood, which will question the very foundation of our societies.

      "synopsis": "Can you be a perpetrator and a victim at the same time? A harrowing question of diminished responsibility is complicated by the horrors of Uganda's post-civil war atrocities.\r\n\r\nThe International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague is charging Dominic Ongwen with 70 different counts of crimes committed whilst in a commanding role in rebel leader Joseph Kony's Lord's Resistance Army (LRA). Ongwen's defence lawyer, Krispus Ayena, is preparing to argue that his client was abducted at the age of 9 and brainwashed by Kony, who used a combination of Christianity, witchcraft and torture to turn thousands of children into LRA killing machines, in his rebellion against Ugandan president Yoweri Museveni.\r\n\r\n\r\nGrappling with a deeply complex moral conundrum of guilt and punishment, against the backdrop of Uganda's 'theatre of violence', this unprecedented film encourages viewers to confront difficult questions about the various meanings of 'justice'.",
