But those who loved her considered her an exciting cultural force, and a loving mother – and innocent of the accusations. Never-seen-before home movies and family photographs explore life with the Rolling Stones and tell a bittersweet tale of both triumph and heartbreak.

Winner of the Best Actor award at Cannes 2023, Koji Yakusho (Babel, 13 Assassins) stars as Hirayama, a contemplative middle-aged man who lives a life of modesty and serenity, spending his days balancing his job as a dutiful caretaker of Tokyo’s numerous public toilets with his passion for music, literature and photography. As we join him on his structured daily routine, a series of unexpected encounters gradually begin to reveal a hidden past that lies behind his otherwise content and harmonious life. \n\nCombining a refreshingly unstereotypical depiction of the Japanese capital with a soundtrack comprised of iconic hits from the 60s and 80s, this is a subtle, shimmering and ultimately life-affirming reflection on finding beauty in the everyday world around us. Japan’s entry for Best International Film at the 2024 Academy Awards.\n",

Six years before her\r\ndeath, a wealthy gallerist, Judith Alexander, 'discovered' her and introduced her work to the art world.\r\n\r\nOver four acts and an interlude, This World is Not My Own traces the lifespan of an outsider artist, while exploring the personal and political events that shaped her singular body of work.

Labudović’s work documented the birth of the Non-Aligned Movement in 1961 - a bloc including many decolonizing nations that stood apart from both East and West during the Cold War.\r\n\r\nWhat begins as an exploration of newsreel footage of the 1961 Non-Aligned summit in Belgrade becomes a love letter to a vanished country and its hopes for the future, a history of the early days of the Non-Aligned Movement, and a document of the affinity between two filmmakers—Turajlić, in her forties, and Labudović, nearing 90.\r\n\r\nShot in Belgrade, New York, and Algeria, and featuring archival footage from around the globe filmed by Labudović, this is a subtle, complex documentary, adroitly blending personal and global histories.\r\n\r\nAlso Playing: Ciné-Guerrillas: Scenes from the Labudović Reels + Q&A\r\n\r\nScenes from the Labudović Reels is a documentary diptych of two feature-length films by Mila Turajlić that take us on an archival road trip through the birth of the Third World project, based on unseen 35mm materials filmed by Stevan Labudović, the cameraman of Yugoslav President Tito.",

When their famous logo came up on screen, Scorsese says, \"You knew you were in for fantasy, wonder, magic - real film magic.\"\r\n\r\nNow, he tells the story of his lifelong love-affair with their movies, including The Red Shoes, The Life and Death Of Colonel Blimp, Black Narcissus, and The Tales of Hoffmann.\r\n\r\nDrawing on a rich array of archive material, Scorsese explores in full the collaboration between the Englishman Powell and the Hungarian Pressburger - two romantics and idealists, who thrived in the face of adversity during World War II but were eventually brought low by the film industry of the 1950s.\r\n\r\nIn this intimate, personal celebration of their films, Scorsese celebrates Powell and Pressburger's ability to create \"subversive commercial movies\" and describes how deeply their films have influenced his own work.",

An assortment of people from all walks of life who have a strong connection to the gallery make surprising choices of both well-known and lesser-known artworks. Finally, some well-known celebrities explain what they head for when they visit the gallery. These stories are used as a lens through which to explore the 200-year history of the National Gallery and what the future may hold for this spectacular space.",

But those who loved her considered her an exciting cultural force, and a loving mother – and innocent of the accusations. Never-seen-before home movies and family photographs explore life with the Rolling Stones and tell a bittersweet tale of both triumph and heartbreak. From Barbarella to the Swiss Alps, and the Lower East Side to London, Anita Pallenberg was a creative force ahead of her time.",

      "synopsis": "A highly anticipated return to fiction feature filmmaking from Wim Wenders (Paris, Texas, Wings of Desire), PERFECT DAYS takes the writer-director to Tokyo to tell a story celebrating the hidden joys and minutiae of Japanese culture. Winner of the Best Actor award at Cannes 2023, Koji Yakusho (Babel, 13 Assassins) stars as Hirayama, a contemplative middle-aged man who lives a life of modesty and serenity, spending his days balancing his job as a dutiful caretaker of Tokyo’s numerous public toilets with his passion for music, literature and photography. As we join him on his structured daily routine, a series of unexpected encounters gradually begin to reveal a hidden past that lies behind his otherwise content and harmonious life. \n\nCombining a refreshingly unstereotypical depiction of the Japanese capital with a soundtrack comprised of iconic hits from the 60s and 80s, this is a subtle, shimmering and ultimately life-affirming reflection on finding beauty in the everyday world around us. Japan’s entry for Best International Film at the 2024 Academy Awards.\n",

She was touted as a 'voodoo priestess' and an 'evil seductress', accused of trying to break up the Rolling Stones.\r\n\r\nDrawing on words from her unpublished memoir, narrated by Scarlett Johansson, this intimate portrait  explores Anita's life as she saw it herself, drawing us deep into her world, with the help of a supporting cast that includes her family - Marlon, Angela, and their father Keith Richards.  \r\n\r\nNever-seen-before home movies and family photographs explore life with the Rolling Stones, in a bittersweet tale of both triumph and heartbreak. From Barbarella to the Swiss Alps, and the Lower East Side to London, Anita Pallenberg was a creative force ahead of her time.",

Turajlić, from the same city, had never heard of him.\r\n\r\nLabudović had been handpicked by Yugoslav President Josep Broz Tito to support the Algerian anti-colonial effort by making films that countered French propaganda. He lived with the Algerian fighters, filming them as they traveled through the mountains. Through intimate interviews with Labudović and his Algerian revolutionary contemporaries, along with his rediscovered newsreels, Ciné-Guerrillas plunges us into the media battle that played out during the Algerian war for independence, where cinema was mobilized as a weapon of political struggle against colonialism.\r\n\r\nAlso Playing: Non-Aligned: Scenes from the Labudović Reels\r\n\r\nScenes from the Labudović Reels is a documentary diptych of two feature-length films by Mila Turajlić that take us on an archival road trip through the birth of the Third World project, based on unseen 35mm materials filmed by Stevan Labudović, the cameraman of Yugoslav President Tito.",

In the well-timed sequel, Food, Inc. 2, comes “back for seconds” to reveal how corporate consolidation has gone unchecked by our government, leaving us with a highly efficient yet shockingly vulnerable food system dedicated only towards increasing profits. Seeking solutions, the film introduces innovative farmers, food producers, workers’ rights activists and legislators fighting to create a more sustainable future.\n\nSince the first film, multinational corporations have tightened their stronghold on the U.S. government. The system at large has robbed workers of a fair living wage, and profit focused corporations are proliferating a chemically formulated international health crisis by focusing on growing the market for ultra-processed foods. The film centers around innovative farmers, future-thinking food producers, workers’ rights activists and prominent legislators such as U.S Senators Cory Booker and Jon Tester, who are facing these companies head-on to inspire change and build a healthier, more sustainable future.",

But those who loved her considered her an exciting cultural force, and a loving mother – and innocent of the accusations. Never-seen-before home movies and family photographs explore life with the Rolling Stones and tell a bittersweet tale of both triumph and heartbreak. From Barbarella to the Swiss Alps, and the Lower East Side to London, Anita Pallenberg was a creative force ahead of her time.",

Winner of the Best Actor award at Cannes 2023, Koji Yakusho (Babel, 13 Assassins) stars as Hirayama, a contemplative middle-aged man who lives a life of modesty and serenity, spending his days balancing his job as a dutiful caretaker of Tokyo’s numerous public toilets with his passion for music, literature and photography. As we join him on his structured daily routine, a series of unexpected encounters gradually begin to reveal a hidden past that lies behind his otherwise content and harmonious life. \n\nCombining a refreshingly unstereotypical depiction of the Japanese capital with a soundtrack comprised of iconic hits from the 60s and 80s, this is a subtle, shimmering and ultimately life-affirming reflection on finding beauty in the everyday world around us. Japan’s entry for Best International Film at the 2024 Academy Awards.\n",

Six years before her\r\ndeath, a wealthy gallerist, Judith Alexander, 'discovered' her and introduced her work to the art world.\r\n\r\nOver four acts and an interlude, This World is Not My Own traces the lifespan of an outsider artist, while exploring the personal and political events that shaped her singular body of work.

But those who loved her considered her an exciting cultural force, and a loving mother – and innocent of the accusations. Never-seen-before home movies and family photographs explore life with the Rolling Stones and tell a bittersweet tale of both triumph and heartbreak.

Winner of the Best Actor award at Cannes 2023, Koji Yakusho (Babel, 13 Assassins) stars as Hirayama, a contemplative middle-aged man who lives a life of modesty and serenity, spending his days balancing his job as a dutiful caretaker of Tokyo’s numerous public toilets with his passion for music, literature and photography. As we join him on his structured daily routine, a series of unexpected encounters gradually begin to reveal a hidden past that lies behind his otherwise content and harmonious life. \n\nCombining a refreshingly unstereotypical depiction of the Japanese capital with a soundtrack comprised of iconic hits from the 60s and 80s, this is a subtle, shimmering and ultimately life-affirming reflection on finding beauty in the everyday world around us. Japan’s entry for Best International Film at the 2024 Academy Awards.\n",

      "synopsis": "Sebastián Lelio (Gloria) returns with a groundbreaking, captivating and deeply humane story about a trans woman’s fight for acceptance. Anchored by a powerhouse central performance from rising star Daniela Vega, this Oscar-nominated film is an urgent call for compassion towards a community that faces bigotry and hostility on a daily basis.\n\nVega plays Marina Vidal, a young singer whose life is thrown into turmoil following the sudden death of her partner, Orlando. Met with suspicion from the police and contempt from her lover’s relatives, Marina finds herself placed under intense scrutiny, with no regard for her privacy, or her grief. As tensions rise between Marina and Orlando’s family, she is evicted from their shared home and banned from attending his funeral. But faced with the threat of losing everything, Marina finds the strength to fight back.\n\nFrom the producers of Jackie and Toni Erdmann, A Fantastic Woman is an outstanding, timely work. Soaked in luminous visuals and elevated by elegant flights of surrealism, the film recalls the very best work of Pedro Almodóvar. It is a courageous, audacious and defiant declaration of Marina’s status as a woman – and a fantastic one, at that.",

But, operating in a world of paranoia and mistrust, he is soon mired in suspicion and controversy himself, and just as the director struggles to unpick truth from rumour, Zam is convinced into taking a trip back to the Middle East.\r\n\r\nSon of the Mullah is a breathtaking story of bravery, conspiracy and betrayal; a film about the hypocrisy of power which brings the viewer into close contact with the brutal grip of the Iranian regime.",
