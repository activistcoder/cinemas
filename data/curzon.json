As we join him on his structured daily routine, a series of unexpected encounters gradually begin to reveal a hidden past that lies behind his otherwise content and harmonious life. \n\nCombining a refreshingly unstereotypical depiction of the Japanese capital with a soundtrack comprised of iconic hits from the 60s and 80s, this is a subtle, shimmering and ultimately life-affirming reflection on finding beauty in the everyday world around us.

This work is also committed to Tarr's 'remodernist cinema' that seeks to capture the rhythm of life in real time and to raise a sharp awareness of the moment.",

Unfortunately, they drew an away match and suffered a crushing 10-0 defeat. But now, Kari is determined to bring football home to the village, entering the FA Cup once again.\r\n\r\nDirectors Smari Gunn and Logi Sigursveinsson follow along as he pulls together his ragtag local team - a fisherman and his son, a pessimistic church warden and a mother of three - and they train for the match of their lives.\r\n\r\nWinner of multiple festival audience awards, The Home Game is an uplifting celebration of team and community spirit, with a finale that will have even staunchest non-football fan cheering from the sidelines.",

Following a man and his daughter in their daily routine, a bizarre series of disturbing events slowly begin to strip life of its very essence resulting in a terrifying, all-consuming finale.\n\nRaw, compelling and emotionally devastating, Béla Tarr’s final film is a daringly original and searingly vivid work of artistically precise, philosophically rigorous filmmaking that has left audiences the world over gasping for breath. This work is also committed to Tarr's 'remodernist cinema' that seeks to capture the rhythm of life in real time and to raise a sharp awareness of the moment.",

As we join him on his structured daily routine, a series of unexpected encounters gradually begin to reveal a hidden past that lies behind his otherwise content and harmonious life. \n\nCombining a refreshingly unstereotypical depiction of the Japanese capital with a soundtrack comprised of iconic hits from the 60s and 80s, this is a subtle, shimmering and ultimately life-affirming reflection on finding beauty in the everyday world around us. Japan’s entry for Best International Film at the 2024 Academy Awards.\n",

But now, Kari is determined to bring football home to the village, entering the FA Cup once again.\r\n\r\nDirectors Smari Gunn and Logi Sigursveinsson follow along as he pulls together his ragtag local team - a fisherman and his son, a pessimistic church warden and a mother of three - and they train for the match of their lives.\r\n\r\nWinner of multiple festival audience awards, The Home Game is an uplifting celebration of team and community spirit, with a finale that will have even staunchest non-football fan cheering from the sidelines.",

      "synopsis": "The sci-fi/horror-thriller takes the phenomenally successful “Alien” franchise back to its roots: While scavenging the deep ends of a derelict space station, a group of young space colonizers come face to face with the most terrifying life form in the universe. The film stars Cailee Spaeny (“Priscilla”), David Jonsson (“Agatha Christie’s Murder is Easy”), Archie Renaux (“Shadow and Bone”), Isabela Merced (“The Last of Us”), Spike Fearn (“Aftersun”), Aileen Wu. Fede Alvarez (“Evil Dead,” “Don’t Breathe”) directs from a screenplay he wrote with frequent collaborator Rodo Sayagues (“Don’t Breathe 2”) based on characters created by Dan O’Bannon and Ronald Shusett. “Alien: Romulus” is produced by Ridley Scott (“Napoleon”), who directed the original “Alien” and produced and directed the series’ entries “Prometheus” and “Alien: Covenant,” Michael Pruss (“Boston Strangler”), and Walter Hill (“Alien”), with Fede Alvarez, Elizabeth Cantillon (“Charlie’s Angels”), Brent O’Connor (“Bullet Train”), and Tom Moran (“Unstoppable”) serving as executive producers.",

As we join him on his structured daily routine, a series of unexpected encounters gradually begin to reveal a hidden past that lies behind his otherwise content and harmonious life. \n\nCombining a refreshingly unstereotypical depiction of the Japanese capital with a soundtrack comprised of iconic hits from the 60s and 80s, this is a subtle, shimmering and ultimately life-affirming reflection on finding beauty in the everyday world around us.

Working through her award-winning documentary collective, Docmakers, veteran filmmaker Raes (0.03 Seconde, Two Men, Close to Vermeer) carves out a disarmingly tender rumination on parent-child relationships.\r\n\r\nGiving equal weight to each sibling, balancing the light and shade of the physical and emotional spaces of their lives, Where Dragons Live also features some dazzling visuals in the way it presents this personal history.",

Swan Song captures the dramatic creation process from the rigours of the rehearsal studio to the much-anticipated, breathtaking opening night.\r\n\r\nFocusing in on performers from the corps de ballet right up to the principal dancer, the choreographer, crew and Karen Kain herself, this is a fascinating immersion into the guts and graft behind the beauty of the ballet.

      "synopsis": "Pitchblack Playback presents a pre-release listening party (in the dark!) of Nick Cave and The Bad Seeds' fabulous new album WILD GOD.\r\n\r\n“I hope the album has the effect on listeners that it’s had on me,” Cave says. “It bursts out of the speaker, and I get swept up with it. It’s a complicated record, but it’s also deeply and joyously infectious. There is never a masterplan when we make a record. The records rather reflect back the emotional state of the writers and musicians who played them. Listening to this, I don’t know, it seems we’re happy.”\r\n\r\nAcross ten tracks, the band dance between convention and experimentation, taking left-turns and detours that heighten the rich imagery and emotion in Cave’s soul-stirring narratives. It is the sound of a group emboldened by reconnection and taking flight. There are moments that touch fondly upon the Bad Seeds’ past but they are fleeting, and serve only to imbue the relentless and restless forward motion of the band.\r\n\r\nProduced by Cave and Warren Ellis, and mixed by David Fridmann, Cave began writing the album on New Year’s Day 2023. With sessions at Miraval in Provence and Soundtree in London, the Bad Seeds added their unique alchemy, with additional performances from Colin Greenwood (bass) and Luis Almau (nylon string guitar, acoustic guitar).\r\n\r\n“Wild God… there’s no f***ing around with this record. When it hits, it hits. It lifts you. It moves you. I love that about it.” -- Nick Cave\r\n\r\n‘Wild God’ will be released on Bad Seed in partnership with Play It Again Sam on streaming, CD, and standard and limited edition vinyl.\r\n\r\nHear the stunning album before anyone else on Curzon's powerful surround sound system at Pitchblack Playback's listening session in the dark—the ultimate way to hear it for the first time. No distractions—just you and the music. Ticket includes Pitchblack Playback eye mask for extra darkness. Please arrive by event start time as latecomers will not be permitted!",

      "synopsis": "A highly anticipated return to fiction feature filmmaking from Wim Wenders (Paris, Texas, Wings of Desire), PERFECT DAYS takes the writer-director to Tokyo to tell a story celebrating the hidden joys and minutiae of Japanese culture. Winner of the Best Actor award at Cannes 2023, Koji Yakusho (Babel, 13 Assassins) stars as Hirayama, a contemplative middle-aged man who lives a life of modesty and serenity, spending his days balancing his job as a dutiful caretaker of Tokyo’s numerous public toilets with his passion for music, literature and photography. As we join him on his structured daily routine, a series of unexpected encounters gradually begin to reveal a hidden past that lies behind his otherwise content and harmonious life. \n\nCombining a refreshingly unstereotypical depiction of the Japanese capital with a soundtrack comprised of iconic hits from the 60s and 80s, this is a subtle, shimmering and ultimately life-affirming reflection on finding beauty in the everyday world around us. Japan’s entry for Best International Film at the 2024 Academy Awards.\n",

But now, Kari is determined to bring football home to the village, entering the FA Cup once again.\r\n\r\nDirectors Smari Gunn and Logi Sigursveinsson follow along as he pulls together his ragtag local team - a fisherman and his son, a pessimistic church warden and a mother of three - and they train for the match of their lives.\r\n\r\nWinner of multiple festival audience awards, The Home Game is an uplifting celebration of team and community spirit, with a finale that will have even staunchest non-football fan cheering from the sidelines.",
