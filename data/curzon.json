It was an inspirational but sanitised retelling of one man’s need to come to terms with the lasting trauma of war. Bernie’s adventure, spanning a mere 48 hours, also marked the culmination of his 60-year marriage to Rene (Glenda Jackson) – THE GREAT ESCAPER celebrates their enduring love but always with an eye to the lessons we might learn from the Greatest Generation.",

Hamm Jr. (Bad Words) and Peele. The film also stars Caleb Landry Jones (X-Men series), Stephen Root (No Country for Old Men), Milton “Lil Rel” Howery (The Carmichael Show), Betty Gabriel (The Purge: Election Year), Marcus Henderson (Pete’s Dragon) and Lakeith Stanfield (Straight Outta Compton).\r\n",

It was an inspirational but sanitised retelling of one man’s need to come to terms with the lasting trauma of war. Bernie’s adventure, spanning a mere 48 hours, also marked the culmination of his 60-year marriage to Rene (Glenda Jackson) – THE GREAT ESCAPER celebrates their enduring love but always with an eye to the lessons we might learn from the Greatest Generation.",

And yet the longer he waits, the more he thinks he's losing his mind, if not his cool. A brutal, bloody and stylish noir story of a professional assassin lost in a world without a moral compass, this is a case study of a man alone, armed to the teeth and slowly losing his mind.",

The wealth of these Native Americans immediately attracted white interlopers, who manipulated, extorted, and stole as much Osage money as they could before resorting to murder. Based on a true story and told through the improbable romance of Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Mollie Kyle (Lily Gladstone), “Killers of the Flower Moon” is an epic western crime saga, where real love crosses paths with unspeakable betrayal. Also starring Robert De Niro and Jesse Plemons, “Killers of the Flower Moon” is directed by Academy Award winner Martin Scorsese from a screenplay by Eric Roth and Martin Scorsese, based on David Grann’s best-selling book.",

Painted in Vienna around 1908, the evocative image of an unknown embracing couple has captivated viewers with its mystery, sensuality and dazzling materials ever since it was created. But just what lies behind the appeal of the painting – and just who was the artist that created it? Delving into the details of real gold, decorative designs, symbolism and simmering erotica, a close study of the painting takes us to the remarkable turn of the century Vienna when a new world was battling with the old. From the director of ‘Frida Kahlo’ and ‘Mary Cassatt – Painting the Modern Woman’ comes a powerful, gripping and passionate new film.",

It was a story that captured the imagination of the world as Bernie embodied the defiant, “can-do” spirit of a generation that was fast disappearing. But of course, it wasn’t the whole story. It was an inspirational but sanitised retelling of one man’s need to come to terms with the lasting trauma of war. Bernie’s adventure, spanning a mere 48 hours, also marked the culmination of his 60-year marriage to Rene (Glenda Jackson) – THE GREAT ESCAPER celebrates their enduring love but always with an eye to the lessons we might learn from the Greatest Generation.",

      "synopsis": "At the turn of the 20th century, oil brought a fortune to the Osage Nation, who became some of the richest people in the world overnight. The wealth of these Native Americans immediately attracted white interlopers, who manipulated, extorted, and stole as much Osage money as they could before resorting to murder. Based on a true story and told through the improbable romance of Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Mollie Kyle (Lily Gladstone), “Killers of the Flower Moon” is an epic western crime saga, where real love crosses paths with unspeakable betrayal. Also starring Robert De Niro and Jesse Plemons, “Killers of the Flower Moon” is directed by Academy Award winner Martin Scorsese from a screenplay by Eric Roth and Martin Scorsese, based on David Grann’s best-selling book.",

It was an inspirational but sanitised retelling of one man’s need to come to terms with the lasting trauma of war. Bernie’s adventure, spanning a mere 48 hours, also marked the culmination of his 60-year marriage to Rene (Glenda Jackson) – THE GREAT ESCAPER celebrates their enduring love but always with an eye to the lessons we might learn from the Greatest Generation.",

After quickly becoming enraptured by the provocative world of Dali, the façade begins to fade when he uncovers that behind the glitz and glamour lies a fragile genius, haunted by the past and unprepared for the changing tide of the world around him.",

Directed by DGA award and five-time Tony award winner George C. Wolfe and starring Emmy award winner Colman Domingo, Rustin shines a long overdue spotlight on the extraordinary man who, alongside giants like the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr., Adam Clayton Powell Jr., and Ella Baker, dared to imagine a different world, and inspired a movement in a march toward freedom. Produced by Academy award winner Bruce Cohen, Higher Ground's Tonia Davis and George C. Wolfe, the film features an all-star cast including Chris Rock, Glynn Turman, Jeffrey Wright and Audra McDonald.",

      "synopsis": "There has never been a biopic about Samuel Beckett and his remarkable life, and this ground-breaking film pivots around the 1969 Nobel Prize ceremony when he was awarded the prize for Literature. \nHaving been awarded £30,000 along with the Nobel Prize, an embarrassed Beckett simply wanted to be rid of the money, and the film revolves around the internal debate raging within Beckett as to which of the people in his life most deserve to be the financial beneficiaries of his shame. \nBeckett lived a life of many parts: rebellious son of an austere mother, Parisian bon vivant, Resistance fighter, Nobel Prize-winning playwright, unfaithful husband, recluse, but despite all the adulation that came his way he was a man acutely aware of his own failings. We explore these different chapters of his life by having Beckett analyse his past with a representation of his own conscience.\nWith typical Beckettian surrealism we’ll see Sam literally climb the walls at the Nobel Prize ceremony to escape the limelight and flee to a place where, with his trademark deadpan humour, he spars with himself as he explores the most significant relationships of his life: with his mother May, his best friend Alfy, his mentor James Joyce, his wife Suzanne and his mistress Barbara. \nBeckett weaves a compelling narrative of guilt and regret that begins with his oppressive home life in Dublin with his mother May, the reaction to which was a bohemian adventure in Paris working with his friend Alfy as a translator for the legendary Irish author James Joyce.\nJoyce went from intimidating mentor to friend via a period of awkwardness caused by Sam’s spurning of his daughter Lucia’s unrequited affections. His rejection accelerated Lucia’s downward spiral and ultimately landed her in a mental institution. \nAlthough Sam didn’t connect romantically with Lucia, it was in Paris where he met his decades-long partner and eventual wife Suzanne, who he got to know when she visited him in hospital after he had been stabbed by a pimp.\nThis precedes a tense period with the French resistance, whom Beckett helped pass messages under the noses of the Nazis, from whom he and Suzanne had a narrow escape. They fled to Provence and spent the rest of the war living a tough but peaceful existence in the countryside, while Sam’s best friend Alfy wasn’t so lucky. His capture and death in a concentration camp prompts yet more shame. \nNone of this can compare to the guilt occasioned by Beckett’s longstanding affair with a BBC employee, Barbara Bray, that causes irreparable damage to his marriage. Pouring salt in Suzanne’s still open wound, Beckett publicly dramatized their situation in the theatre as ‘Play’, his creative urges yet again causing turbulence in his rollercoaster life. \nSuzanne had acted as the driving force promoting his career, and she remained by his side for the rest of his life despite his numerous infidelities, which were a source of bitterness and rancour. The thing both Sam and Suzanne feared most was success and the spotlight, which they saw as something that could potentially tear them apart, making the award of the Nobel Prize, the ultimate accolade for an author, a veritable ‘catastrophe’, as Beckett described it.",

It was an inspirational but sanitised retelling of one man’s need to come to terms with the lasting trauma of war. Bernie’s adventure, spanning a mere 48 hours, also marked the culmination of his 60-year marriage to Rene (Glenda Jackson) – THE GREAT ESCAPER celebrates their enduring love but always with an eye to the lessons we might learn from the Greatest Generation.",

      "synopsis": "At the turn of the 20th century, oil brought a fortune to the Osage Nation, who became some of the richest people in the world overnight. The wealth of these Native Americans immediately attracted white interlopers, who manipulated, extorted, and stole as much Osage money as they could before resorting to murder. Based on a true story and told through the improbable romance of Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Mollie Kyle (Lily Gladstone), “Killers of the Flower Moon” is an epic western crime saga, where real love crosses paths with unspeakable betrayal. Also starring Robert De Niro and Jesse Plemons, “Killers of the Flower Moon” is directed by Academy Award winner Martin Scorsese from a screenplay by Eric Roth and Martin Scorsese, based on David Grann’s best-selling book.",

Directed by DGA award and five-time Tony award winner George C. Wolfe and starring Emmy award winner Colman Domingo, Rustin shines a long overdue spotlight on the extraordinary man who, alongside giants like the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr., Adam Clayton Powell Jr., and Ella Baker, dared to imagine a different world, and inspired a movement in a march toward freedom. Produced by Academy award winner Bruce Cohen, Higher Ground's Tonia Davis and George C. Wolfe, the film features an all-star cast including Chris Rock, Glynn Turman, Jeffrey Wright and Audra McDonald.",

It was a story that captured the imagination of the world as Bernie embodied the defiant, “can-do” spirit of a generation that was fast disappearing. But of course, it wasn’t the whole story. It was an inspirational but sanitised retelling of one man’s need to come to terms with the lasting trauma of war. Bernie’s adventure, spanning a mere 48 hours, also marked the culmination of his 60-year marriage to Rene (Glenda Jackson) – THE GREAT ESCAPER celebrates their enduring love but always with an eye to the lessons we might learn from the Greatest Generation.",

      "synopsis": "There has never been a biopic about Samuel Beckett and his remarkable life, and this ground-breaking film pivots around the 1969 Nobel Prize ceremony when he was awarded the prize for Literature. \nHaving been awarded £30,000 along with the Nobel Prize, an embarrassed Beckett simply wanted to be rid of the money, and the film revolves around the internal debate raging within Beckett as to which of the people in his life most deserve to be the financial beneficiaries of his shame. \nBeckett lived a life of many parts: rebellious son of an austere mother, Parisian bon vivant, Resistance fighter, Nobel Prize-winning playwright, unfaithful husband, recluse, but despite all the adulation that came his way he was a man acutely aware of his own failings. We explore these different chapters of his life by having Beckett analyse his past with a representation of his own conscience.\nWith typical Beckettian surrealism we’ll see Sam literally climb the walls at the Nobel Prize ceremony to escape the limelight and flee to a place where, with his trademark deadpan humour, he spars with himself as he explores the most significant relationships of his life: with his mother May, his best friend Alfy, his mentor James Joyce, his wife Suzanne and his mistress Barbara. \nBeckett weaves a compelling narrative of guilt and regret that begins with his oppressive home life in Dublin with his mother May, the reaction to which was a bohemian adventure in Paris working with his friend Alfy as a translator for the legendary Irish author James Joyce.\nJoyce went from intimidating mentor to friend via a period of awkwardness caused by Sam’s spurning of his daughter Lucia’s unrequited affections. His rejection accelerated Lucia’s downward spiral and ultimately landed her in a mental institution. \nAlthough Sam didn’t connect romantically with Lucia, it was in Paris where he met his decades-long partner and eventual wife Suzanne, who he got to know when she visited him in hospital after he had been stabbed by a pimp.\nThis precedes a tense period with the French resistance, whom Beckett helped pass messages under the noses of the Nazis, from whom he and Suzanne had a narrow escape. They fled to Provence and spent the rest of the war living a tough but peaceful existence in the countryside, while Sam’s best friend Alfy wasn’t so lucky. His capture and death in a concentration camp prompts yet more shame. \nNone of this can compare to the guilt occasioned by Beckett’s longstanding affair with a BBC employee, Barbara Bray, that causes irreparable damage to his marriage. Pouring salt in Suzanne’s still open wound, Beckett publicly dramatized their situation in the theatre as ‘Play’, his creative urges yet again causing turbulence in his rollercoaster life. \nSuzanne had acted as the driving force promoting his career, and she remained by his side for the rest of his life despite his numerous infidelities, which were a source of bitterness and rancour. The thing both Sam and Suzanne feared most was success and the spotlight, which they saw as something that could potentially tear them apart, making the award of the Nobel Prize, the ultimate accolade for an author, a veritable ‘catastrophe’, as Beckett described it.",

The story of this improbable, utopic return to the Sahel region follows a winding path that travels through ecological and decolonial challenges from the 1970s to the present day.\r\n\r\nOne of the major actors of the movement, Bouba Touré, tells this story by plunging into the heart of his personal archives, documenting the fights of farmers in France and in Mali, as well as those of immigrant workers, over a period of decades. Over the course of the film, different voices enter the soundscape to accompany Bouba Touré's telling, making this a story about dialogues and transmission, friendships and cinematic geographies.",

The expat population teemed with singers, songwriters and musicians, pining for their homeland and producing music from and for the community, amidst the appalling working conditions and racism they encountered in their new home. Love, Deutschmarks and Death follows the music from the early 60s, through waves of migration and assimilation, from back-room recordings to lavish wedding performances, and from bootlegged cassettes to a new generation of young performers.The energy and vibrancy of the music pulses through Cem Kaya's fascinating, archive-rich telling of this rarely shown - or heard - cultural history.\"",

Covering a span of 13 years, director Lea Glob follows Apolonia’s attempts to find her place - both in the artworld and in her own life story. But Apolonia's resilience is put to the test as she navigates an often-unforgiving industry.\r\n\r\nApolonia Apolonia celebrates the intimacy and friendship created between its filmmaker and subject.

The wealth of these Native Americans immediately attracted white interlopers, who manipulated, extorted, and stole as much Osage money as they could before resorting to murder. Based on a true story and told through the improbable romance of Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Mollie Kyle (Lily Gladstone), “Killers of the Flower Moon” is an epic western crime saga, where real love crosses paths with unspeakable betrayal. Also starring Robert De Niro and Jesse Plemons, “Killers of the Flower Moon” is directed by Academy Award winner Martin Scorsese from a screenplay by Eric Roth and Martin Scorsese, based on David Grann’s best-selling book.",

Directed by DGA award and five-time Tony award winner George C. Wolfe and starring Emmy award winner Colman Domingo, Rustin shines a long overdue spotlight on the extraordinary man who, alongside giants like the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr., Adam Clayton Powell Jr., and Ella Baker, dared to imagine a different world, and inspired a movement in a march toward freedom. Produced by Academy award winner Bruce Cohen, Higher Ground's Tonia Davis and George C. Wolfe, the film features an all-star cast including Chris Rock, Glynn Turman, Jeffrey Wright and Audra McDonald.",

      "synopsis": "There has never been a biopic about Samuel Beckett and his remarkable life, and this ground-breaking film pivots around the 1969 Nobel Prize ceremony when he was awarded the prize for Literature. \nHaving been awarded £30,000 along with the Nobel Prize, an embarrassed Beckett simply wanted to be rid of the money, and the film revolves around the internal debate raging within Beckett as to which of the people in his life most deserve to be the financial beneficiaries of his shame. \nBeckett lived a life of many parts: rebellious son of an austere mother, Parisian bon vivant, Resistance fighter, Nobel Prize-winning playwright, unfaithful husband, recluse, but despite all the adulation that came his way he was a man acutely aware of his own failings. We explore these different chapters of his life by having Beckett analyse his past with a representation of his own conscience.\nWith typical Beckettian surrealism we’ll see Sam literally climb the walls at the Nobel Prize ceremony to escape the limelight and flee to a place where, with his trademark deadpan humour, he spars with himself as he explores the most significant relationships of his life: with his mother May, his best friend Alfy, his mentor James Joyce, his wife Suzanne and his mistress Barbara. \nBeckett weaves a compelling narrative of guilt and regret that begins with his oppressive home life in Dublin with his mother May, the reaction to which was a bohemian adventure in Paris working with his friend Alfy as a translator for the legendary Irish author James Joyce.\nJoyce went from intimidating mentor to friend via a period of awkwardness caused by Sam’s spurning of his daughter Lucia’s unrequited affections. His rejection accelerated Lucia’s downward spiral and ultimately landed her in a mental institution. \nAlthough Sam didn’t connect romantically with Lucia, it was in Paris where he met his decades-long partner and eventual wife Suzanne, who he got to know when she visited him in hospital after he had been stabbed by a pimp.\nThis precedes a tense period with the French resistance, whom Beckett helped pass messages under the noses of the Nazis, from whom he and Suzanne had a narrow escape. They fled to Provence and spent the rest of the war living a tough but peaceful existence in the countryside, while Sam’s best friend Alfy wasn’t so lucky. His capture and death in a concentration camp prompts yet more shame. \nNone of this can compare to the guilt occasioned by Beckett’s longstanding affair with a BBC employee, Barbara Bray, that causes irreparable damage to his marriage. Pouring salt in Suzanne’s still open wound, Beckett publicly dramatized their situation in the theatre as ‘Play’, his creative urges yet again causing turbulence in his rollercoaster life. \nSuzanne had acted as the driving force promoting his career, and she remained by his side for the rest of his life despite his numerous infidelities, which were a source of bitterness and rancour. The thing both Sam and Suzanne feared most was success and the spotlight, which they saw as something that could potentially tear them apart, making the award of the Nobel Prize, the ultimate accolade for an author, a veritable ‘catastrophe’, as Beckett described it.",

He had staged a “great escape” from his care home to join fellow war veterans on a beach in Normandy, commemorating their fallen comrades at the D-Day Landings 70th anniversary. It was a story that captured the imagination of the world as Bernie embodied the defiant, “can-do” spirit of a generation that was fast disappearing. But of course, it wasn’t the whole story. It was an inspirational but sanitised retelling of one man’s need to come to terms with the lasting trauma of war. Bernie’s adventure, spanning a mere 48 hours, also marked the culmination of his 60-year marriage to Rene (Glenda Jackson) – THE GREAT ESCAPER celebrates their enduring love but always with an eye to the lessons we might learn from the Greatest Generation.",

The author will sign copies of the book following the screening.\r\nBergman's modernist masterpiece explores the volatile relationship between an actress who refuses to speak and the nurse overseeing her convalescence.\r\n After a mischievous montage 'explaining' the film's origins, the narrative proper gets underway, charting the increasingly tense battle of wits between the chatty Alma (Andersson) and the mute Elisabet (Ullmann), who are isolated together in a cottage on the island of Fårö. With a rich, resonant mix of related themes - the vampiric nature of art, the complex fragility of personality, the difficulty of communication - the film is arguably Bergman's most audacious and formally innovative work, multi-levelled yet utterly lucid. Sven Nykvist's lustrous camerawork, the subtle sound design and matchless lead performances combine to create a mesmerisingly beautiful work of unforgettable, haunting mystery.\r\nWith thanks to Faber & Faber.",

      "synopsis": "The architect of 1963’s momentous March on Washington, Bayard Rustin was one of the greatest activists and organizers the world has ever known. He challenged authority, never apologized for who he was, what he believed, or who he desired. And he did not back down. He made history, and in turn, he was forgotten. Directed by DGA award and five-time Tony award winner George C. Wolfe and starring Emmy award winner Colman Domingo, Rustin shines a long overdue spotlight on the extraordinary man who, alongside giants like the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr., Adam Clayton Powell Jr., and Ella Baker, dared to imagine a different world, and inspired a movement in a march toward freedom. Produced by Academy award winner Bruce Cohen, Higher Ground's Tonia Davis and George C. Wolfe, the film features an all-star cast including Chris Rock, Glynn Turman, Jeffrey Wright and Audra McDonald.",

He had staged a “great escape” from his care home to join fellow war veterans on a beach in Normandy, commemorating their fallen comrades at the D-Day Landings 70th anniversary. It was a story that captured the imagination of the world as Bernie embodied the defiant, “can-do” spirit of a generation that was fast disappearing. But of course, it wasn’t the whole story. It was an inspirational but sanitised retelling of one man’s need to come to terms with the lasting trauma of war. Bernie’s adventure, spanning a mere 48 hours, also marked the culmination of his 60-year marriage to Rene (Glenda Jackson) – THE GREAT ESCAPER celebrates their enduring love but always with an eye to the lessons we might learn from the Greatest Generation.",

      "trailer": null,
      "synopsis": "There has never been a biopic about Samuel Beckett and his remarkable life, and this ground-breaking film pivots around the 1969 Nobel Prize ceremony when he was awarded the prize for Literature. \nHaving been awarded £30,000 along with the Nobel Prize, an embarrassed Beckett simply wanted to be rid of the money, and the film revolves around the internal debate raging within Beckett as to which of the people in his life most deserve to be the financial beneficiaries of his shame. \nBeckett lived a life of many parts: rebellious son of an austere mother, Parisian bon vivant, Resistance fighter, Nobel Prize-winning playwright, unfaithful husband, recluse, but despite all the adulation that came his way he was a man acutely aware of his own failings. We explore these different chapters of his life by having Beckett analyse his past with a representation of his own conscience.\nWith typical Beckettian surrealism we’ll see Sam literally climb the walls at the Nobel Prize ceremony to escape the limelight and flee to a place where, with his trademark deadpan humour, he spars with himself as he explores the most significant relationships of his life: with his mother May, his best friend Alfy, his mentor James Joyce, his wife Suzanne and his mistress Barbara. \nBeckett weaves a compelling narrative of guilt and regret that begins with his oppressive home life in Dublin with his mother May, the reaction to which was a bohemian adventure in Paris working with his friend Alfy as a translator for the legendary Irish author James Joyce.\nJoyce went from intimidating mentor to friend via a period of awkwardness caused by Sam’s spurning of his daughter Lucia’s unrequited affections. His rejection accelerated Lucia’s downward spiral and ultimately landed her in a mental institution. \nAlthough Sam didn’t connect romantically with Lucia, it was in Paris where he met his decades-long partner and eventual wife Suzanne, who he got to know when she visited him in hospital after he had been stabbed by a pimp.\nThis precedes a tense period with the French resistance, whom Beckett helped pass messages under the noses of the Nazis, from whom he and Suzanne had a narrow escape. They fled to Provence and spent the rest of the war living a tough but peaceful existence in the countryside, while Sam’s best friend Alfy wasn’t so lucky. His capture and death in a concentration camp prompts yet more shame. \nNone of this can compare to the guilt occasioned by Beckett’s longstanding affair with a BBC employee, Barbara Bray, that causes irreparable damage to his marriage. Pouring salt in Suzanne’s still open wound, Beckett publicly dramatized their situation in the theatre as ‘Play’, his creative urges yet again causing turbulence in his rollercoaster life. \nSuzanne had acted as the driving force promoting his career, and she remained by his side for the rest of his life despite his numerous infidelities, which were a source of bitterness and rancour. The thing both Sam and Suzanne feared most was success and the spotlight, which they saw as something that could potentially tear them apart, making the award of the Nobel Prize, the ultimate accolade for an author, a veritable ‘catastrophe’, as Beckett described it.",
