      "synopsis": "A 1920s English seaside town bears witness to a dark and absurd scandal in this riotous mystery comedy. Based on a stranger than fiction true story, WICKED LITTLE LETTERS follows two neighbours: deeply conservative local Edith Swan (Olivia Colman) and rowdy Irish migrant Rose Gooding (Jessie Buckley). When Edith and fellow residents begin to receive wicked letters full of unintentionally hilarious profanities, foulmouthed Rose is charged with the crime. The anonymous letters prompt a national uproar, and a trial ensues. However, as the town's women - led by Police Officer Gladys Moss (Anjana Vasan) - begin to investigate the crime themselves, they suspect that something is amiss, and Rose may not be the culprit after all.",

To prove his point, Monk uses a pen name to write an outlandish “Black” book of his own, a book that propels him to the heart of hypocrisy and the madness he claims to disdain.",

Winner of the Best Actor award at Cannes 2023, Koji Yakusho (Babel, 13 Assassins) stars as Hirayama, a contemplative middle-aged man who lives a life of modesty and serenity, spending his days balancing his job as a dutiful caretaker of Tokyo’s numerous public toilets with his passion for music, literature and photography. As we join him on his structured daily routine, a series of unexpected encounters gradually begin to reveal a hidden past that lies behind his otherwise content and harmonious life. \n\nCombining a refreshingly unstereotypical depiction of the Japanese capital with a soundtrack comprised of iconic hits from the 60s and 80s, this is a subtle, shimmering and ultimately life-affirming reflection on finding beauty in the everyday world around us. Japan’s entry for Best International Film at the 2024 Academy Awards.\n",

This time, he embeds us into the world of the most fragile link on the chain: kids. The youngsters he follows - collectively anonymised as Ernesto - have been drawn into the pervasive, enticing world of the cartels, where guns are readily available and there's money to be earned.\r\n\r\nGonzález's cameras, mounted just behind their heads, peer into the obscured world around them, as they detail their lives, their crimes and the limited options for escape.\r\n\r\nPushing the boundaries of documentary-making, as well as of comfort, A Wolfpack Called Ernesto is an unforgettable, searing insight into the world of these young sicarios.",

This portrait of a generation follows a group of teens living through the dog days of the war that had been burning since 2014, with the prospect of a coming invasion gathering momentum. An imaginative band of dreamers, their hopes for their futures are tempered by the limits of the world the around them, and the sound of gunfire is never far away.\r\n\r\nInto this picture comes an extraordinary opportunity: an expedition to the Himalayas that will provide a brief escape from the reality of war, and open up untold new horizons.\r\n\r\nUkrainian director Alisa Kovalenko's perceptive gaze gently captures a coming-of-age tale like no other, and a generation that, in spite of everything, is able to recognise and celebrate the fragile beauty of life.",

The British architects Alison & Peter Smithson failed with their grand, utopian vision for better living, but what is really behind the ostracized facade?\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the participation of residents, experts and critics, and collaborations with Harvard University, the V&A and the Venice Biennale, Robin Hood Gardens paints a polychromatic portrait of this building complex, reappraising the intentions behind it and the backlash against it, in search of answers about the failing of modernism.",

When Edith and fellow residents begin to receive wicked letters full of unintentionally hilarious profanities, foulmouthed Rose is charged with the crime. The anonymous letters prompt a national uproar, and a trial ensues. However, as the town's women - led by Police Officer Gladys Moss (Anjana Vasan) - begin to investigate the crime themselves, they suspect that something is amiss, and Rose may not be the culprit after all.",

To prove his point, Monk uses a pen name to write an outlandish “Black” book of his own, a book that propels him to the heart of hypocrisy and the madness he claims to disdain.",

Winner of the Best Actor award at Cannes 2023, Koji Yakusho (Babel, 13 Assassins) stars as Hirayama, a contemplative middle-aged man who lives a life of modesty and serenity, spending his days balancing his job as a dutiful caretaker of Tokyo’s numerous public toilets with his passion for music, literature and photography. As we join him on his structured daily routine, a series of unexpected encounters gradually begin to reveal a hidden past that lies behind his otherwise content and harmonious life. \n\nCombining a refreshingly unstereotypical depiction of the Japanese capital with a soundtrack comprised of iconic hits from the 60s and 80s, this is a subtle, shimmering and ultimately life-affirming reflection on finding beauty in the everyday world around us. Japan’s entry for Best International Film at the 2024 Academy Awards.\n",

A harrowing question of diminished responsibility is complicated by the horrors of Uganda's post-civil war atrocities.\r\n\r\nThe International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague is charging Dominic Ongwen with 70 different counts of crimes committed whilst in a commanding role in rebel leader Joseph Kony's Lord's Resistance Army (LRA). Ongwen's defence lawyer, Krispus Ayena, is preparing to argue that his client was abducted at the age of 9 and brainwashed by Kony, who used a combination of Christianity, witchcraft and torture to turn thousands of children into LRA killing machines, in his rebellion against Ugandan president Yoweri Museveni.\r\n\r\n\r\nGrappling with a deeply complex moral conundrum of guilt and punishment, against the backdrop of Uganda's 'theatre of violence', this unprecedented film encourages viewers to confront difficult questions about the various meanings of 'justice'.",

Based on a stranger than fiction true story, WICKED LITTLE LETTERS follows two neighbours: deeply conservative local Edith Swan (Olivia Colman) and rowdy Irish migrant Rose Gooding (Jessie Buckley). When Edith and fellow residents begin to receive wicked letters full of unintentionally hilarious profanities, foulmouthed Rose is charged with the crime. The anonymous letters prompt a national uproar, and a trial ensues. However, as the town's women - led by Police Officer Gladys Moss (Anjana Vasan) - begin to investigate the crime themselves, they suspect that something is amiss, and Rose may not be the culprit after all.",

Winner of the Best Actor award at Cannes 2023, Koji Yakusho (Babel, 13 Assassins) stars as Hirayama, a contemplative middle-aged man who lives a life of modesty and serenity, spending his days balancing his job as a dutiful caretaker of Tokyo’s numerous public toilets with his passion for music, literature and photography. As we join him on his structured daily routine, a series of unexpected encounters gradually begin to reveal a hidden past that lies behind his otherwise content and harmonious life. \n\nCombining a refreshingly unstereotypical depiction of the Japanese capital with a soundtrack comprised of iconic hits from the 60s and 80s, this is a subtle, shimmering and ultimately life-affirming reflection on finding beauty in the everyday world around us. Japan’s entry for Best International Film at the 2024 Academy Awards.\n",

A harrowing question of diminished responsibility is complicated by the horrors of Uganda's post-civil war atrocities.\r\n\r\nThe International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague is charging Dominic Ongwen with 70 different counts of crimes committed whilst in a commanding role in rebel leader Joseph Kony's Lord's Resistance Army (LRA). Ongwen's defence lawyer, Krispus Ayena, is preparing to argue that his client was abducted at the age of 9 and brainwashed by Kony, who used a combination of Christianity, witchcraft and torture to turn thousands of children into LRA killing machines, in his rebellion against Ugandan president Yoweri Museveni.\r\n\r\n\r\nGrappling with a deeply complex moral conundrum of guilt and punishment, against the backdrop of Uganda's 'theatre of violence', this unprecedented film encourages viewers to confront difficult questions about the various meanings of 'justice'.",

While the younger two are present to re-enact scenes from their family history, the disappearance of the older two from the family home becomes the central burning question around which the narrative spirals.\r\n\r\nThe two missing sisters will be played by professional actors in staged reconstructions, guided by Olfa and her younger girls, and multi-award-winning Tunisian-Egyptian actor Hend Sabri steps into Olfa's shoes, and into the narrative.\r\n\r\nAs bonds form between the family members and the actors, director Kaouther Ben Hania sets up an extraordinary film mechanism to unveil the story of Olfa and her family.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn intimate journey full of hope, rebellion, violence, intergenerational transmission and sisterhood, which will question the very foundation of our societies.

An imaginative band of dreamers, their hopes for their futures are tempered by the limits of the world the around them, and the sound of gunfire is never far away.\r\n\r\nInto this picture comes an extraordinary opportunity: an expedition to the Himalayas that will provide a brief escape from the reality of war, and open up untold new horizons.\r\n\r\nUkrainian director Alisa Kovalenko's perceptive gaze gently captures a coming-of-age tale like no other, and a generation that, in spite of everything, is able to recognise and celebrate the fragile beauty of life.",

To prove his point, Monk uses a pen name to write an outlandish “Black” book of his own, a book that propels him to the heart of hypocrisy and the madness he claims to disdain.",

Based on a stranger than fiction true story, WICKED LITTLE LETTERS follows two neighbours: deeply conservative local Edith Swan (Olivia Colman) and rowdy Irish migrant Rose Gooding (Jessie Buckley). When Edith and fellow residents begin to receive wicked letters full of unintentionally hilarious profanities, foulmouthed Rose is charged with the crime. The anonymous letters prompt a national uproar, and a trial ensues. However, as the town's women - led by Police Officer Gladys Moss (Anjana Vasan) - begin to investigate the crime themselves, they suspect that something is amiss, and Rose may not be the culprit after all.",

Winner of the Best Actor award at Cannes 2023, Koji Yakusho (Babel, 13 Assassins) stars as Hirayama, a contemplative middle-aged man who lives a life of modesty and serenity, spending his days balancing his job as a dutiful caretaker of Tokyo’s numerous public toilets with his passion for music, literature and photography. As we join him on his structured daily routine, a series of unexpected encounters gradually begin to reveal a hidden past that lies behind his otherwise content and harmonious life. \n\nCombining a refreshingly unstereotypical depiction of the Japanese capital with a soundtrack comprised of iconic hits from the 60s and 80s, this is a subtle, shimmering and ultimately life-affirming reflection on finding beauty in the everyday world around us. Japan’s entry for Best International Film at the 2024 Academy Awards.\n",

One shows the city’s devastating Nazi occupation through door-to-door accounts – tales of Jewish persecution, of resistance, collaboration, valour, and denial. The other is a vivid journey through the last years of pandemic and protest. The combination has a transformative effect with which McQueen opens up a poetic, dreamlike space where unthinkable history and hope for a new future co-exist.",

A harrowing question of diminished responsibility is complicated by the horrors of Uganda's post-civil war atrocities.\r\n\r\nThe International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague is charging Dominic Ongwen with 70 different counts of crimes committed whilst in a commanding role in rebel leader Joseph Kony's Lord's Resistance Army (LRA). Ongwen's defence lawyer, Krispus Ayena, is preparing to argue that his client was abducted at the age of 9 and brainwashed by Kony, who used a combination of Christianity, witchcraft and torture to turn thousands of children into LRA killing machines, in his rebellion against Ugandan president Yoweri Museveni.\r\n\r\n\r\nGrappling with a deeply complex moral conundrum of guilt and punishment, against the backdrop of Uganda's 'theatre of violence', this unprecedented film encourages viewers to confront difficult questions about the various meanings of 'justice'.",

While the younger two are present to re-enact scenes from their family history, the disappearance of the older two from the family home becomes the central burning question around which the narrative spirals.\r\n\r\nThe two missing sisters will be played by professional actors in staged reconstructions, guided by Olfa and her younger girls, and multi-award-winning Tunisian-Egyptian actor Hend Sabri steps into Olfa's shoes, and into the narrative.\r\n\r\nAs bonds form between the family members and the actors, director Kaouther Ben Hania sets up an extraordinary film mechanism to unveil the story of Olfa and her family.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn intimate journey full of hope, rebellion, violence, intergenerational transmission and sisterhood, which will question the very foundation of our societies.

Based on a stranger than fiction true story, WICKED LITTLE LETTERS follows two neighbours: deeply conservative local Edith Swan (Olivia Colman) and rowdy Irish migrant Rose Gooding (Jessie Buckley). When Edith and fellow residents begin to receive wicked letters full of unintentionally hilarious profanities, foulmouthed Rose is charged with the crime. The anonymous letters prompt a national uproar, and a trial ensues. However, as the town's women - led by Police Officer Gladys Moss (Anjana Vasan) - begin to investigate the crime themselves, they suspect that something is amiss, and Rose may not be the culprit after all.",

Jeffrey Wright stars as Monk, a frustrated novelist who’s fed up with the establishment profiting from “Black” entertainment that relies on tired and offensive tropes. To prove his point, Monk uses a pen name to write an outlandish “Black” book of his own, a book that propels him to the heart of hypocrisy and the madness he claims to disdain.",

Winner of the Best Actor award at Cannes 2023, Koji Yakusho (Babel, 13 Assassins) stars as Hirayama, a contemplative middle-aged man who lives a life of modesty and serenity, spending his days balancing his job as a dutiful caretaker of Tokyo’s numerous public toilets with his passion for music, literature and photography. As we join him on his structured daily routine, a series of unexpected encounters gradually begin to reveal a hidden past that lies behind his otherwise content and harmonious life. \n\nCombining a refreshingly unstereotypical depiction of the Japanese capital with a soundtrack comprised of iconic hits from the 60s and 80s, this is a subtle, shimmering and ultimately life-affirming reflection on finding beauty in the everyday world around us. Japan’s entry for Best International Film at the 2024 Academy Awards.\n",

A harrowing question of diminished responsibility is complicated by the horrors of Uganda's post-civil war atrocities.\r\n\r\nThe International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague is charging Dominic Ongwen with 70 different counts of crimes committed whilst in a commanding role in rebel leader Joseph Kony's Lord's Resistance Army (LRA). Ongwen's defence lawyer, Krispus Ayena, is preparing to argue that his client was abducted at the age of 9 and brainwashed by Kony, who used a combination of Christianity, witchcraft and torture to turn thousands of children into LRA killing machines, in his rebellion against Ugandan president Yoweri Museveni.\r\n\r\n\r\nGrappling with a deeply complex moral conundrum of guilt and punishment, against the backdrop of Uganda's 'theatre of violence', this unprecedented film encourages viewers to confront difficult questions about the various meanings of 'justice'.",

While the younger two are present to re-enact scenes from their family history, the disappearance of the older two from the family home becomes the central burning question around which the narrative spirals.\r\n\r\nThe two missing sisters will be played by professional actors in staged reconstructions, guided by Olfa and her younger girls, and multi-award-winning Tunisian-Egyptian actor Hend Sabri steps into Olfa's shoes, and into the narrative.\r\n\r\nAs bonds form between the family members and the actors, director Kaouther Ben Hania sets up an extraordinary film mechanism to unveil the story of Olfa and her family.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn intimate journey full of hope, rebellion, violence, intergenerational transmission and sisterhood, which will question the very foundation of our societies.

An imaginative band of dreamers, their hopes for their futures are tempered by the limits of the world the around them, and the sound of gunfire is never far away.\r\n\r\nInto this picture comes an extraordinary opportunity: an expedition to the Himalayas that will provide a brief escape from the reality of war, and open up untold new horizons.\r\n\r\nUkrainian director Alisa Kovalenko's perceptive gaze gently captures a coming-of-age tale like no other, and a generation that, in spite of everything, is able to recognise and celebrate the fragile beauty of life.",

When Edith and fellow residents begin to receive wicked letters full of unintentionally hilarious profanities, foulmouthed Rose is charged with the crime. The anonymous letters prompt a national uproar, and a trial ensues. However, as the town's women - led by Police Officer Gladys Moss (Anjana Vasan) - begin to investigate the crime themselves, they suspect that something is amiss, and Rose may not be the culprit after all.",

To prove his point, Monk uses a pen name to write an outlandish “Black” book of his own, a book that propels him to the heart of hypocrisy and the madness he claims to disdain.",

Winner of the Best Actor award at Cannes 2023, Koji Yakusho (Babel, 13 Assassins) stars as Hirayama, a contemplative middle-aged man who lives a life of modesty and serenity, spending his days balancing his job as a dutiful caretaker of Tokyo’s numerous public toilets with his passion for music, literature and photography. As we join him on his structured daily routine, a series of unexpected encounters gradually begin to reveal a hidden past that lies behind his otherwise content and harmonious life. \n\nCombining a refreshingly unstereotypical depiction of the Japanese capital with a soundtrack comprised of iconic hits from the 60s and 80s, this is a subtle, shimmering and ultimately life-affirming reflection on finding beauty in the everyday world around us. Japan’s entry for Best International Film at the 2024 Academy Awards.\n",

While the younger two are present to re-enact scenes from their family history, the disappearance of the older two from the family home becomes the central burning question around which the narrative spirals.\r\n\r\nThe two missing sisters will be played by professional actors in staged reconstructions, guided by Olfa and her younger girls, and multi-award-winning Tunisian-Egyptian actor Hend Sabri steps into Olfa's shoes, and into the narrative.\r\n\r\nAs bonds form between the family members and the actors, director Kaouther Ben Hania sets up an extraordinary film mechanism to unveil the story of Olfa and her family.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn intimate journey full of hope, rebellion, violence, intergenerational transmission and sisterhood, which will question the very foundation of our societies.

A harrowing question of diminished responsibility is complicated by the horrors of Uganda's post-civil war atrocities.\r\n\r\nThe International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague is charging Dominic Ongwen with 70 different counts of crimes committed whilst in a commanding role in rebel leader Joseph Kony's Lord's Resistance Army (LRA). Ongwen's defence lawyer, Krispus Ayena, is preparing to argue that his client was abducted at the age of 9 and brainwashed by Kony, who used a combination of Christianity, witchcraft and torture to turn thousands of children into LRA killing machines, in his rebellion against Ugandan president Yoweri Museveni.\r\n\r\n\r\nGrappling with a deeply complex moral conundrum of guilt and punishment, against the backdrop of Uganda's 'theatre of violence', this unprecedented film encourages viewers to confront difficult questions about the various meanings of 'justice'.",

Jeffrey Wright stars as Monk, a frustrated novelist who’s fed up with the establishment profiting from “Black” entertainment that relies on tired and offensive tropes. To prove his point, Monk uses a pen name to write an outlandish “Black” book of his own, a book that propels him to the heart of hypocrisy and the madness he claims to disdain.",

Based on a stranger than fiction true story, WICKED LITTLE LETTERS follows two neighbours: deeply conservative local Edith Swan (Olivia Colman) and rowdy Irish migrant Rose Gooding (Jessie Buckley). When Edith and fellow residents begin to receive wicked letters full of unintentionally hilarious profanities, foulmouthed Rose is charged with the crime. The anonymous letters prompt a national uproar, and a trial ensues. However, as the town's women - led by Police Officer Gladys Moss (Anjana Vasan) - begin to investigate the crime themselves, they suspect that something is amiss, and Rose may not be the culprit after all.",

For this frank, forceful and inspiring documentary, she returns to her former haunts and speaks to current and former homeless people about why, twenty-five years later, record numbers of people are still reduced to living on Britain's streets. As we hear the life stories of extraordinary individuals, and learn how the system has both aided and failed them, this raw, intimate and unforgettable film asks: why hasn’t public policy placed this issue firmly in the past? How can we help? And what contribution can those with experience of homelessness make to putting effective solutions in place?",

Winner of the Best Actor award at Cannes 2023, Koji Yakusho (Babel, 13 Assassins) stars as Hirayama, a contemplative middle-aged man who lives a life of modesty and serenity, spending his days balancing his job as a dutiful caretaker of Tokyo’s numerous public toilets with his passion for music, literature and photography. As we join him on his structured daily routine, a series of unexpected encounters gradually begin to reveal a hidden past that lies behind his otherwise content and harmonious life. \n\nCombining a refreshingly unstereotypical depiction of the Japanese capital with a soundtrack comprised of iconic hits from the 60s and 80s, this is a subtle, shimmering and ultimately life-affirming reflection on finding beauty in the everyday world around us. Japan’s entry for Best International Film at the 2024 Academy Awards.\n",

      "synopsis": "An intimately raw and magical journey through the life, mind, and heart of iconic artist Frida Kahlo, Frida is told through her own words for the very first time, drawn from her famed illustrated diary, revealing letters, essays, and candid print interviews — and brought vividly to life by lyrical animation inspired by her unforgettable artwork. The feature film directorial debut of acclaimed editor Carla Gutiérrez (RBG, La Corona), Frida posits a striking context as to why the artist – and her art -- remains as powerful as ever. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCovering more than 40 years of her life, the filmmakers received unrestricted access to research materials, much never shown to the general public before. What is extraordinary about Kahlo's life and art is how her images would galvanize multiple generations of admirers worldwide, doing more than solidifying her status as a modern artist of timeless import. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAn intensive journey spanning two years, Gutiérrez and her formidable team of artisans, most of whom are women and proudly Latine, gathered together to craft a singular cinematic experience that could be no ordinary art history lesson. A living portrait emboldened by the magical realism befitting Kahlo's remarkable life emerges. Yet, her voice ultimately stands supreme, a complex and powerful sound of a multitude of Fridas: fearless, seductive, defiant, vulnerable, raucous, and wonderfully alive.",

While the younger two are present to re-enact scenes from their family history, the disappearance of the older two from the family home becomes the central burning question around which the narrative spirals.\r\n\r\nThe two missing sisters will be played by professional actors in staged reconstructions, guided by Olfa and her younger girls, and multi-award-winning Tunisian-Egyptian actor Hend Sabri steps into Olfa's shoes, and into the narrative.\r\n\r\nAs bonds form between the family members and the actors, director Kaouther Ben Hania sets up an extraordinary film mechanism to unveil the story of Olfa and her family.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn intimate journey full of hope, rebellion, violence, intergenerational transmission and sisterhood, which will question the very foundation of our societies.

When Edith and fellow residents begin to receive wicked letters full of unintentionally hilarious profanities, foulmouthed Rose is charged with the crime. The anonymous letters prompt a national uproar, and a trial ensues. However, as the town's women - led by Police Officer Gladys Moss (Anjana Vasan) - begin to investigate the crime themselves, they suspect that something is amiss, and Rose may not be the culprit after all.",

Jeffrey Wright stars as Monk, a frustrated novelist who’s fed up with the establishment profiting from “Black” entertainment that relies on tired and offensive tropes. To prove his point, Monk uses a pen name to write an outlandish “Black” book of his own, a book that propels him to the heart of hypocrisy and the madness he claims to disdain.",

Winner of the Best Actor award at Cannes 2023, Koji Yakusho (Babel, 13 Assassins) stars as Hirayama, a contemplative middle-aged man who lives a life of modesty and serenity, spending his days balancing his job as a dutiful caretaker of Tokyo’s numerous public toilets with his passion for music, literature and photography. As we join him on his structured daily routine, a series of unexpected encounters gradually begin to reveal a hidden past that lies behind his otherwise content and harmonious life. \n\nCombining a refreshingly unstereotypical depiction of the Japanese capital with a soundtrack comprised of iconic hits from the 60s and 80s, this is a subtle, shimmering and ultimately life-affirming reflection on finding beauty in the everyday world around us. Japan’s entry for Best International Film at the 2024 Academy Awards.\n",

An imaginative band of dreamers, their hopes for their futures are tempered by the limits of the world the around them, and the sound of gunfire is never far away.\r\n\r\nInto this picture comes an extraordinary opportunity: an expedition to the Himalayas that will provide a brief escape from the reality of war, and open up untold new horizons.\r\n\r\nUkrainian director Alisa Kovalenko's perceptive gaze gently captures a coming-of-age tale like no other, and a generation that, in spite of everything, is able to recognise and celebrate the fragile beauty of life.",

      "synopsis": "Formally inventive and strikingly astute, this Oscar-nominated hybrid explores the life of Tunisian mother Olfa and her four daughters. While the younger two are present to re-enact scenes from their family history, the disappearance of the older two from the family home becomes the central burning question around which the narrative spirals.\r\n\r\nThe two missing sisters will be played by professional actors in staged reconstructions, guided by Olfa and her younger girls, and multi-award-winning Tunisian-Egyptian actor Hend Sabri steps into Olfa's shoes, and into the narrative.\r\n\r\nAs bonds form between the family members and the actors, director Kaouther Ben Hania sets up an extraordinary film mechanism to unveil the story of Olfa and her family.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn intimate journey full of hope, rebellion, violence, intergenerational transmission and sisterhood, which will question the very foundation of our societies.

      "synopsis": "Can you be a perpetrator and a victim at the same time? A harrowing question of diminished responsibility is complicated by the horrors of Uganda's post-civil war atrocities.\r\n\r\nThe International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague is charging Dominic Ongwen with 70 different counts of crimes committed whilst in a commanding role in rebel leader Joseph Kony's Lord's Resistance Army (LRA). Ongwen's defence lawyer, Krispus Ayena, is preparing to argue that his client was abducted at the age of 9 and brainwashed by Kony, who used a combination of Christianity, witchcraft and torture to turn thousands of children into LRA killing machines, in his rebellion against Ugandan president Yoweri Museveni.\r\n\r\n\r\nGrappling with a deeply complex moral conundrum of guilt and punishment, against the backdrop of Uganda's 'theatre of violence', this unprecedented film encourages viewers to confront difficult questions about the various meanings of 'justice'.",
