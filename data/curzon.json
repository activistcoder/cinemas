Directed by DGA award and five-time Tony award winner George C. Wolfe and starring Emmy award winner Colman Domingo, Rustin shines a long overdue spotlight on the extraordinary man who, alongside giants like the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr., Adam Clayton Powell Jr., and Ella Baker, dared to imagine a different world, and inspired a movement in a march toward freedom. Produced by Academy award winner Bruce Cohen, Higher Ground's Tonia Davis and George C. Wolfe, the film features an all-star cast including Chris Rock, Glynn Turman, Jeffrey Wright and Audra McDonald.",

Repetition of the everyday and the never-ending skyline offer assurance and ease. Or compel you to investigate the most pressing question plaguing Londoners: what are those 200-foot metal structures dotting the city?  \r\n\r\nThis brilliant line up of London centric films captures the widely experienced emotions of anxiety, the unsettling shift into adulthood, and the dreaded \"panic years.\" One filmmaker examines why we accept things the way we do in a wry and amusing documentary, while another brings alive the historic landscape in a series of visually compelling montages. Warda Mohamed’s debut narrative intimately depicts the different ways people can grieve and the unexpected connections you can find in those solemn moments.\r\n\r\nProgramme:\r\n– Highgate 214, dir.

Using a treasure trove of archive footage, The Disappearance of Shere Hite transports viewers back to a time of great societal change and transformation around sexuality. It rediscovers a pioneer who has had an unmistakable influence on current conversations around gender and sexuality, and asks what led to Shere's erasure.",

This anthology of shorts from filmmakers outside of the capital attempts to reflect the nation and its people in all of their complicated, idiosyncratic, multitudinous glory. Join us as we journey through England, Scotland and Wales to unearth new work that captures something of the experience of living in a certain place, location-specific rituals and quirks, and the interiority of our fellow countrypeople. \r\n\r\nOur stops along the way include a military training exercise for delivering tragic news, the strange connection between Welsh proverbs and motorised transport, and hear the mythic tale of the Smoking Dolphins, told in a working men’s club.\r\n\r\nProgramme:\r\n– Desire Lines, dir. Duncan Cowles, UK 2022, 8mins\r\n– Starling, dir. Matthew Boyle, UK 2023, 13mins\r\n– Stable, dir. David Leon, UK 2023, 16mins\r\n– Smoking Dolphins, dir.

With outstanding critical acclaim, The Holdovers is now the winner of 2 Golden Globes for Best Actor (Comedy) for Paul Giamatti and Best Supporting Actress for Da’Vine Joy Randolph.",

Using a treasure trove of archive footage, The Disappearance of Shere Hite transports viewers back to a time of great societal change and transformation around sexuality. It rediscovers a pioneer who has had an unmistakable influence on current conversations around gender and sexuality, and asks what led to Shere's erasure.",

But both her methodology and her message came under criticism in the backlash from this popularity, and slowly but surely Shere was ridiculed and squeezed out of the mainstream - and eventually out of popular consciousness.\r\n\r\nDirector Nicole Newnham (Crip Camp) recovers Shere Hite from the margins of history, feminism and academia, exploring the charismatic former model's rise and fall from prominence. Using a treasure trove of archive footage, The Disappearance of Shere Hite transports viewers back to a time of great societal change and transformation around sexuality. It rediscovers a pioneer who has had an unmistakable influence on current conversations around gender and sexuality, and asks what led to Shere's erasure.",

It is stories like these that have made this most remarkable director a cult figure the world over.\r\n\r\nThis comprehensive portrait by director Thomas von Steinaecke explores Herzog's work, process and everyday life, bringing together rare archive materials and in-depth interviews with the man himself, as well as celebrated collaborators - including Joshua Oppenheimer, Patti Smith, Christian Bale, Nicole Kidman and his wife, Lena Herzog.",

But her own role in the developing movement has been neglected.\r\n\r\nA gorgeous film to watch, set to the soundtrack of Miúcha's music and saturated with Bossa Nova vibes, Miúcha: The Voice of Bossa Nova tells her story through 16mm home movies, diaries, personal letters and her own expressive watercolour paintings, animated for the film.\r\n\r\nEven as she struggled to find her own voice in the shadow of her revered husband, Miúcha went on to earn unprecedented success, becoming a symbol of female resilience and a musical legend.",

Eventually he forms an unlikely bond with one of them -- a damaged, brainy troublemaker (newcomer Dominic Sessa) -- and with the school’s head cook, who lost a son in Vietnam (Da’Vine Joy Randolph). With outstanding critical acclaim, The Holdovers is now the winner of 2 Golden Globes for Best Actor (Comedy) for Paul Giamatti and Best Supporting Actress for Da’Vine Joy Randolph.",

It is stories like these that have made this most remarkable director a cult figure the world over.\r\n\r\nThis comprehensive portrait by director Thomas von Steinaecke explores Herzog's work, process and everyday life, bringing together rare archive materials and in-depth interviews with the man himself, as well as celebrated collaborators - including Joshua Oppenheimer, Patti Smith, Christian Bale, Nicole Kidman and his wife, Lena Herzog.",
