Her younger, flightier and rebellious roommate, Anu, tries in vain to find a spot in the city to be intimate with her secret boyfriend.

A trip to a beach town allows them each to find a space for their desires to manifest. \n\nPayal Kapadia’s hugely acclaimed fiction debut was the first Indian film to be selected in Official Competition at Cannes in three decades, where it was awarded the Grand Prix.\n",

Set in post-World War II England, it centres on the fleet of staff who quietly toil in the stately home Darlington Hall, under the watchful eye of Anthony Hopkins’ unwaveringly professional butler Mr Stevens. He has feelings for the warm-hearted housekeeper Miss Kenton (Emma Thompson), but his stiff-upper-lip restraint prevents him from saying anything.",

Interspersed throughout are interviews with prominent journalists, Israeli statesmen, Netanyahu's associates, and longtime friends, whose observations and anecdotes reveal a chilling portrait of a leader who, in his drive to evade justice, has aligned himself with radical right-wing extremists. Netanyahu’s fixation on his entitlement to remain Prime Minister has, in this way, led to political decisions that have endangered Israel’s safety, and destroyed her standing as a democracy in the Middle East.\r\n",

Against the towering landscape of the post-war Swiss Alps, a gifted young physicist meets an elusive pianist– one who knows things about him that he’s never told another living soul. Before he knows it, his curiosity traps him inside a mind-bending metaphysical web of murder and mystery. Drawing on the cinema of masters like Alfred Hitchcock, David Lynch and Fritz Lang, director Timm Kröger impeccably blends past and present, black and white, reality and the surreal, to create something utterly unique.\n\nAmbitious, compelling and visually breathtaking, THE UNIVERSAL THEORY is a lush cinematic mystery not to be missed.",

Ripping down the fences, they set the land back to the wild and entrust its recovery to a motley mix of animals both tame and wild.\r\n\r\nIt is the beginning of a grand experiment that will become one of the most significant rewilding experiments in Europe.",

The most heavily monitored country in the world experiences huge infringements of privacy, (self-)censorship and control, whilst systems such as 'social credit scoring' are being tested and deployed.\r\n\r\nChinese filmmaker Jialing Zhang - now living outside the country since co-directing 2019's One Child Nation - directed this eye-opening exposé remotely, with the support of filmmakers within China, who remain anonymous for their own safety.\r\n\r\nTaking China as a mirror, the film sounds an alarm about the increasing use of surveillance tools around the world - even in democratically run countries. If this is the present, what does our future look like?",

From Oscar- and BAFTA-winning filmmaker and Turner Prize-winning visual artist Steve McQueen, comes this mesmerising and monumental excavation of how the past haunts our precarious present: mirroring it and warning us in plain sight.\r\n\r\nInformed by the book Atlas of an Occupied City: Amsterdam 1940-1945 written by Bianca Stigter, the documentary creates two interlocking portraits. One shows the city’s devastating Nazi occupation through door-to-door accounts – tales of Jewish persecution, of resistance, collaboration, valour, and denial. The other is a vivid journey through the last years of pandemic and protest. The combination has a transformative effect with which McQueen opens up a poetic, dreamlike space where unthinkable history and hope for a new future co-exist.",

As he recalls the progress of the movement, he reunites with friends and former activists, together questioning what has been achieved, twenty years on.\r\n\r\nThis new 4K restoration of I Heard It Through The Grapevine brings James Baldwin back to the screen in his centenary year. While co-directors Dick Fontaine, who passed away in October 2023, and Pat Hartley deftly interweave archive footage, they never stray far from the guiding intellect of Baldwin. The result is an intimate and emotionally charged journey, raising questions that resonate ever louder through the passing decades.\r\n\r\nRestored by Harvard Film Archive. Special thanks to Gugulethu Mseleku, Smokey Fontaine, the late Dick Fontaine, and Pat Hartley.",

      "synopsis": "Originally released in 1982, I Heard it Through the Grapevine is not so much a portrait of the seminal writer James Baldwin, as a deep immersion into his own exploration of the American South, two decades on from the start of the Civil Rights Movement.\r\n\r\nTravelling across the country, Baldwin revisits the landmarks of the Civil Rights struggle and critical sites of resistance - Selma, Birmingham, Atlanta. As he recalls the progress of the movement, he reunites with friends and former activists, together questioning what has been achieved, twenty years on.\r\n\r\nThis new 4K restoration of I Heard It Through The Grapevine brings James Baldwin back to the screen in his centenary year. While co-directors Dick Fontaine, who passed away in October 2023, and Pat Hartley deftly interweave archive footage, they never stray far from the guiding intellect of Baldwin. The result is an intimate and emotionally charged journey, raising questions that resonate ever louder through the passing decades.\r\n\r\nRestored by Harvard Film Archive. Special thanks to Gugulethu Mseleku, Smokey Fontaine, the late Dick Fontaine, and Pat Hartley.",

This gentle, yet painful, film explores the raw, human cost of conflict. Each new passenger, whether they’re women or men, young or old, individuals or families, has first-hand experience of the Russian invasion, and a spectrum of emotions surfaces in the car transporting them to safety. Children quietly read books, a woman weeps for the cow she’s left behind, others are lost for words… Amidst this tragedy, the chaos of conflict and upended lives, there are fleeting moments of humour and hope. And beyond the confines of the minibus, we witness the expanse of rural Ukraine – a vast landscape of natural beauty littered with the carnage of war, and the desolation and destruction of once populated communities.",
