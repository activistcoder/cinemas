Chile has recovered its memory.\r\n\r\nIn his latest film, the renowned documentary-maker returns his razor-sharp gaze to a country on the cusp of long overdue change.  Focussing on the on the pivotal role played by women, he traces the people's path through mass protest to constitutional change. \r\n\r\nWith astonishment and great hope, Guzmán documents Chile's surge towards becoming the country he imagines.",

Based on a true story and told through the improbable romance of Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Mollie Kyle (Lily Gladstone), “Killers of the Flower Moon” is an epic western crime saga, where real love crosses paths with unspeakable betrayal. Also starring Robert De Niro and Jesse Plemons, “Killers of the Flower Moon” is directed by Academy Award winner Martin Scorsese from a screenplay by Eric Roth and Martin Scorsese, based on David Grann’s best-selling book.",

On this final trip, he shows his photographs to the people he meets, who cannot believe the vibrant and prosperous Iraq he presents to them.\r\n\r\nAl-Ani died in 2021, soon after the completion of this film, which forms a moving tribute to the great photographer and the country he lost.\r\n",

      "synopsis": "Ever since the turmoil of 1973 that forced documentary filmmaker Patricio Guzmán to leave Chile, he has documented his homeland - in films such as Nostalgia for the Light, The Pearl Button and The Cordillera of Dreams - a country still suffering under the weight of Pinochet's legacy, constitution and decades of inequality, corruption and denial.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThen, in October 2019, there is an unexpected revolution, a social explosion; one and a half million people demonstrate in the streets of Santiago calling for democracy, a more dignified life and a new constitution. Chile has recovered its memory.\r\n\r\nIn his latest film, the renowned documentary-maker returns his razor-sharp gaze to a country on the cusp of long overdue change.  Focussing on the on the pivotal role played by women, he traces the people's path through mass protest to constitutional change. \r\n\r\nWith astonishment and great hope, Guzmán documents Chile's surge towards becoming the country he imagines.",

      "synopsis": "In Britain’s post-punk Thatcher years, the infamous and legendary Scala cinema showed a diverse range of films, from high art to cult classics, sexploitation, horror, Kung-Fu and LGBTQIA+. Nudging boundaries of convention, it became an inspiration for future famous creatives.\r\n\r\nWith interviews from nearly 50 contributors, previously unseen archive footage and film clips, Scala!!! is an anarchic, uproarious documentary telling the riotous inside story, with an original soundtrack by celebrated musician Barry Adamson.\r\n\r\nTranscending nostalgia, Scala!!! is a universal testament to the power of cinemas, providing refuge and community for outsiders. A place where everyone is welcome.",

      "synopsis": "Feminist researcher Shere Hite changed the discussion around women's sexuality with her groundbreaking studies in the 1970s and 80s, and her books (including The Hite Report) became best-sellers. But both her methodology and her message came under criticism in the backlash from this popularity, and slowly but surely Shere was ridiculed and squeezed out of the mainstream - and eventually out of popular consciousness.\r\n\r\nDirector Nicole Newnham (Crip Camp) recovers Shere Hite from the margins of history, feminism and academia, exploring the charismatic former model's rise and fall from prominence. Using a treasure trove of archive footage, The Disappearance of Shere Hite transports viewers back to a time of great societal change and transformation around sexuality. It rediscovers a pioneer who has had an unmistakable influence on current conversations around gender and sexuality, and asks what led to Shere's erasure.",
