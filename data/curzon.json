With fervent nationalism on the rise, dissidents are labelled as enemies of India, with their lives and livelihoods viciously attacked. With budget cuts, mass resignations and mounting death threats, can Kumar persevere in the face of adversity? While We Watched is a riveting tale of truth, courage and journalistic integrity. Kumar’s unyielding spirit is captured brilliantly, and we watch as he faces seemingly unending challenges. With factual reporting in international crisis, director Vinay Shukla trains his lens on a beleaguered lone voice, providing us with hope that there are still determined forces dedicated to speaking truth to power.\"",

In the dark, enclosed space, her camera - richly lit with beams of golden daylight - frames bodies and faces in chiaroscuro, while the women give voice to their past experiences: sharing, accepting, finding laughter and solace, regaining their strength through a sense of communion.\r\n\r\nWatching Smoke Sauna Sisterhood is a transformative experience for the viewer too, brought into a corporeal world of emotional veracity and deep empathy.",

Chile has recovered its memory.\r\n\r\nIn his latest film, the renowned documentary-maker returns his razor-sharp gaze to a country on the cusp of long overdue change.  Focussing on the on the pivotal role played by women, he traces the people's path through mass protest to constitutional change. \r\n\r\nWith astonishment and great hope, Guzmán documents Chile's surge towards becoming the country he imagines.",

Nudging boundaries of convention, it became an inspiration for future famous creatives.\r\n\r\nWith interviews from nearly 50 contributors, previously unseen archive footage and film clips, Scala!!! is an anarchic, uproarious documentary telling the riotous inside story, with an original soundtrack by celebrated musician Barry Adamson.\r\n\r\nTranscending nostalgia, Scala!!! is a universal testament to the power of cinemas, providing refuge and community for outsiders. A place where everyone is welcome.",

During the subsequent siege and assault, as bombs fall, inhabitants flee, and access to electricity, food, water and medicine are severed, the team — the only international journalists left — struggles to cover the war and to transmit their footage out.\r\n\r\nUkrainian filmmaker and journalist Mstyslav Chernov offers a window into the practices of conflict zone reporters and an unflinching, anguishing account of the 20 days he and colleagues Evgeniy Maloletka and Vasilisa Stepanenko spent covering Mariupol. Chernov wonders how capturing such footage can make a difference, but residents implore them to let the world bear witness.  \r\n",

Nudging boundaries of convention, it became an inspiration for future famous creatives.\r\n\r\nWith interviews from nearly 50 contributors, previously unseen archive footage and film clips, Scala!!! is an anarchic, uproarious documentary telling the riotous inside story, with an original soundtrack by celebrated musician Barry Adamson.\r\n\r\nTranscending nostalgia, Scala!!! is a universal testament to the power of cinemas, providing refuge and community for outsiders. A place where everyone is welcome.",

The rituals of the sauna envelop them, as they wash away the shame trapped in their bodies.\r\n\r\nFilmmaker Anna Hints captures this intimate space up close, without any sense of intrusion. In the dark, enclosed space, her camera - richly lit with beams of golden daylight - frames bodies and faces in chiaroscuro, while the women give voice to their past experiences: sharing, accepting, finding laughter and solace, regaining their strength through a sense of communion.\r\n\r\nWatching Smoke Sauna Sisterhood is a transformative experience for the viewer too, brought into a corporeal world of emotional veracity and deep empathy.",

      "synopsis": "In the warm, dense heat of a Southern Estonian smoke sauna, a group of women share their innermost secrets and intimate experiences. The rituals of the sauna envelop them, as they wash away the shame trapped in their bodies.\r\n\r\nFilmmaker Anna Hints captures this intimate space up close, without any sense of intrusion. In the dark, enclosed space, her camera - richly lit with beams of golden daylight - frames bodies and faces in chiaroscuro, while the women give voice to their past experiences: sharing, accepting, finding laughter and solace, regaining their strength through a sense of communion.\r\n\r\nWatching Smoke Sauna Sisterhood is a transformative experience for the viewer too, brought into a corporeal world of emotional veracity and deep empathy.",

      "synopsis": "Latif al-Ani, the beloved 'father of Iraqi photography', captured his country in its heyday from the 1950s to 1970s. When Saddam Hussein took power, al-Ani put down his camera. His photographs form a unique archive showing a cosmopolitan Iraq, before the devastation of war, that many Westerners and even Iraqi people themselves have never seen.\r\n\r\nIn Iraq's Invisible Beauty, 86-year-old al-Ani travels across his devastated homeland, accompanied by Belgian-Kurdish filmmaker Sahim Omar Kalifa, in search of the places he once knew and captured on film. On this final trip, he shows his photographs to the people he meets, who cannot believe the vibrant and prosperous Iraq he presents to them.\r\n\r\nAl-Ani died in 2021, soon after the completion of this film, which forms a moving tribute to the great photographer and the country he lost.\r\n",
